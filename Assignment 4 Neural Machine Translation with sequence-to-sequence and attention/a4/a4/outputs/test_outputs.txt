You know what I do is write for children, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, and in fact, I am probably the <unk>
And I always tell the people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or <unk> clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany usually is something that was in some place.
You just have to turn back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated circle of which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the middle school, in average, <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of class.
When I was walking up to bleed every week in the bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me enter the bathroom of the teachers.
It was <unk>
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and I had a thumb, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never came to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to do it with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see us, <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, <unk> and take care of her family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I saved her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around <unk> about the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> a <unk> snow after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or break the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of you refuse to give up to <unk> and they hold up to the end, whereas others can't be <unk> more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, by looking at a <unk> that are isolated separate and alone, in large as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts in a <unk> I'm breathing his <unk> atmosphere.
As a iceberg the iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, and knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unusual to come to see a <unk> iceberg here.
Here it is.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a iceberg from Greenland, average size.
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so you know, the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one -- a baby. Okay.
So, two partners every one with a baby.
I don't want you to be <unk> in the details of conception, because if they stop to think about conception -- I'm not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the sperm and the sperm joins the X chromosome in the <unk>
And in the other case, the <unk> chromosome binds to the X chromosome <unk>
Both <unk> and you start life.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my activity in the ground to get two <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a training for formation and what I study in this case is the way that people embrace the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluids -- the idea of the <unk> which have thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with identical twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much more low than the average.
And I've been working with many cases of people with sexual <unk> individuals whose physics of physics does not fit into the male bars and conventional female.
In <unk> we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> embraces many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't be <unk> in the common or female forms of male or female.
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> from the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the life that we all have in the life that we have in the <unk> life.
And then, in life -- the testes is producing testosterone.
But because this individual lacks the receptors of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
This is <unk> <unk>
So there's high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops following a course typically <unk>
When you get the baby out of a little bit of a little girl.
It's a child. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not going to be until puberty, when it's growing and developing your sales but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is going on.
Then you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called areolar glands, <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most of the women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman -- I don't know her <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is something complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old guy born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a guy, and I had just found out he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th chromosomes and in the uterus -- the areolar glands were so active that, in essence, creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component, typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors found that in fact, it was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> is to say, have tissue <unk> wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So there's a lot of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are going to be <unk> twins, or <unk> twins, or <unk> surgeries are not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason that you get to various surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that particular anatomy brings up to <unk> a particular identity.
So we have the idea that being a woman is to have <unk> identity is black wants to say to have African anatomy in terms of <unk>
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of a very romantic <unk>
Imagine the amazing thing that you have children are born like two people inside a body.
The most popular case is last year from the past year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do you test are going to be able to figure out whether it's <unk> it's man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that don't exist such a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't draw a line of <unk> between men and women and women and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we have to go through science, we have to admit that these categories -- we thought these categories were likely to be <unk> by <unk> directly with <unk> categories -- are a lot more <unk> than they <unk>
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact that the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we get in science and we get more and more in a very awkward area where we have to recognize that the categories of <unk> that <unk> are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> arguments today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered died.
Our ancestors had never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him would get a pen in front of your nose, and if he moved it still not to do it.
If he stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract a vital organ of a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the prisoner's dilemma of really somebody's death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I'm nervous.
And we would argue that these categories are much more fragile than we thought to me.
It was from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am a fervent fan, but I am a fervent <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, I find each other so watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
The Parents are <unk> for me, the first activists of the anatomy and I explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and it was <unk> with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we would expect, our parents -- <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it was coming to the political power by the right of blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, and so on.
The parents were rejected by rejected that idea and replacing it for a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the field of play and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> differences. That was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system in which they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there's very clear of course, if you look at the story of Parents -- that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to have a <unk> idea of the right of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> <unk> you talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And it was a consequence of a result of the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
What happened next?
And the women.
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that we prescribe to <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the movement of the <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we have to start wondering why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish to the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be able to focus on anatomy.
I don't want to say that the children of five years would have to be able to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things: <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the day.
Imagine one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
So Henry, the other hand, was born in term: was born last March 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary is being attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for everything that's not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Now, Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the election that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, in his hand, doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So we still have a <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science comes up so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give up to science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science will become <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line in some part, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people got caught in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain point has decided to get married with a man doesn't have to have a chromosome and to get married with a woman has to have a <unk>
Now, in practice they don't do tests with people <unk>
But this is also very strange, given the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good.
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be able to deal with this to support people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the things that I know can be able to make more decisions, smart decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships that people from 40 to know.
So how do you put the subject of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of one person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an <unk>
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current of thinking relative to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context as the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is kind of susceptible to being <unk> unless it's willing to abide a change of sex, in which case it is to be alive.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that I had made a couple of a couple of years ago that they had made a <unk> twins and then pick out the <unk>
But when the phone asked her the business of the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation, told me that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
So I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of separation <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who are <unk> to change the way of the state.
So I think we need to be on your head.
Well, to end up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a bit radical for a feminist, and it is that I think there can be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about them.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in doing the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in are the differences between men and women in the way to think and to operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers that I knew I was interested in feminism feminism considered me <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the smartest question I ever heard.
feminism has to be able to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's no female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, the more I think there is something female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the female and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people by the state, it's possible that there is to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we make democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more in relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect union -- think about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where every family is going to live and work, it has the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this point we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could get it to the <unk> world, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just ran out of buildings out there.
Imagine half of those who wanted to live in apartments already were owners and to the other half of them still supply to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to make <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that are around them have rules to avoid all the time and the development of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place to build a completely new apartment building and when the rules of that place <unk> construction instead of putting it in.
So I proposed that governments -- new reform areas to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later, I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of answering Honduras.
Did you know that every year around 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the following elections, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we had <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> that was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk to TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, tried to reduce this very complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say you can't go and pick up all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it needs so much of technologies like <unk> and usually are the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, we had a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> and in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it begins with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going on, and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called, and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
It's just covering over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, and we have to start with a site that takes about a thousand square miles.
That's more than 100,000 <unk>
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city where you might be able to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the U.S. government would need help from <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries associated with them that will help us establish and make the rules of <unk> so that everybody could trust the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be a thousand square miles.
And soon after, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional willingness to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just been going through this <unk> crisis in Congress to this constitutional <unk> of the constitutional <unk>
All the <unk> all the challenges in society, <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> it has to pass two times in Congress.
On February 17th, he passed over again in a voting -- of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting on the top of the top of the top of the February, a <unk> <unk> <unk> is to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that's building in Korea -- it's bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court of the last sudden for this new <unk>
There are <unk> and builders that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have solved that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to get a job, sometimes they're mothers who have to earn money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even children are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to insist for the families to choose between many cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to do a <unk> and that's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, I put together and more recently, photographing and publish in my blog and colorful <unk> and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> shops and <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand shops allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to know people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> and my aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I would like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
So back to my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings up with someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what suit.
I've brought seven pairs of interior, and nothing else.
<unk> interior for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because I'm not known as the woman who walks for TED in <unk>  -- that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the set to this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look right.
You almost always see you phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, not just <unk> you will be <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the kid that you're in.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like the <unk> or I remind you to their <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's pretty much sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, you don't look there that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and again when people came up to me this week just because of what I was using and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to leave some things.
I don't need emotionally with these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright suit -- if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I get it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
On the left-hand side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be a totally intuitive.
So where are your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extreme ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like this -- with a big <unk> in both of the <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put into play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
So a intuition that can have developed with the step of the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little kid and I didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet my play with that parking bar I taught him a valuable lesson, and it is that the great things don't allow them to get the <unk> and that stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with car bars -- play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of weird things -- like you can go through walls, or you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called this quantum mechanics theory.
At that point there was the physics of a few years -- you needed about quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need to want to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't be touched by my logic.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it didn't work.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right at the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of a little metal metal -- with a springboard and that stands up on a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in the form of swimming <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up and I leave you with doing those things, because I don't want them to get it, or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that happens to its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little metal little bit to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
And then the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled all the air together, and then we put it at a temperature of less than a degree by absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. And the way it <unk> was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft, we were able to make it <unk> and that we don't know at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think of atoms.
In one case, all of the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and at the bottom.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means is that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one single atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same thing that the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you believe it?
I mean, it's my kind of logic I'm talking about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we did, and we turned the lights and we looked into the box, and we saw that the metal followed there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects in the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just going to be <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that true.
It's more than that, it's <unk>
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define you who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and took me 18 months.
A lot of talks and stories, it was <unk> with 17 <unk> very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is simply explaining just to this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
It was a great education of a great education, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
And better than showing you the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So, let's go to <unk>
Look around every museum that there is.
There is the gallery gallery, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the Van <unk>
And I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the <unk> museum in New York City.
There are two ways of doing it very simple.
We click and <unk> we are inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that actually doesn't matter.
You move down there and get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the top, and with one click, we jumped inside.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the hall,
Are you going to keep it forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I've not come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the sign of <unk>
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click right here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the technology <unk>
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there's a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this kid, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to make it out.
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
And I found that the kids were actually playing something.
And I talked a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a pole on Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further deeper and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take a little bit of the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is a painting.
The best thing is to come, one second.
So now we're going to quickly jump at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really the fact that it would be.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it so before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things that are more here, but I don't have a time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same way.
You can online to create their own museum, create your own collection from all of these images.
It's very simple, we walked -- I've created this function that I call "The <unk> <unk> -- we've just done a <unk> around.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things out, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when I look at these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to your work of art and it's represented properly online.
And the great question I'm doing today is you can do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think about it a <unk> a <unk>
We call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian <unk> all the kids in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the last two decades.
So some time ago, if you wanted to win a career, one would take a budget and put it into a good car and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the career.
This is what it is, in engineering, you have a control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
So what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers into the open.
And as <unk> are starting to respond to different ways and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As you can tell, I wanted to say that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet -- but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
More than cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition from <unk> <unk> for weekends at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms that were <unk> and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michelangelo, <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end, I took the hammer -- and he threw it up to the Moses -- you know, you can actually see a little bit of <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and what not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup of the World.
Maybe some of the remember, they were played by Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The line of time is at the top.
At the sooner early there are people here, and there are <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick phone call and the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
Time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They win Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk> at the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day they were all at the center of the U.S. team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the time <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume.
Today we know all about the source of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how do you get?
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we developed a little bit of small tags to track the garbage in their shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago -- to tag what they were doing, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be able to see it.
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage and then we started to <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening very complicated things and there's a lot of transportation <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we stopped at it doesn't come away, it's still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that if the plastic bottle we just go on one day still still there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is push over the environment.
And the first project is something that we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
Everything started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and the South Europe has a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, join with that?
And one of the ideas that we develop at MIT, in a shop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> that you open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water -- with pixels of water.
If the pixels fall through the pixels you can write about patterns, images, images, texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it.
And they took a commission to design the building on the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors and windows, but when you come up to it it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you get down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture goes away.
This is how it works.
You see people <unk> so on the inside.
And here I am myself trying to not be able to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way of interacting had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you happen, but a building that kept making <unk> and water holes and you had to jump out of not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and every one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one that we saw before, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
It's a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal setup in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what it changes is the light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appears on different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D where you can get close, and you go back and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to a <unk> like earlier.
When the lights lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with a input that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet films, the star of New York City and the <unk> of <unk> to capture its <unk> motions and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> it captures it in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity, and <unk>
We want to use this as a input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like an oyster nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all of us get a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- the Obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world, from the <unk> power of the <unk> to the physical world.
In our case, this can we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered the pixels.
You can move around, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom -- serve to share the main moments of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So that's so much a physical cloud of the sky like something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, they could better improve it for a more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be more difficult to be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and more attractive than ourselves?
How about living with good health?
Or maybe be from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is they <unk>
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are going to do it?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> I probably had the number of creative people.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here in the TED Conference but I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great explanation. In the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Catholic Church -- <unk> wrote an essay titled <unk> biology makes sense of <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it about others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is of course, the most interesting thing.
<unk> from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
And there has been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here a few years old.
It might seem to be very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is the same protein, which is coming out of it.
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry in the gut the more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> asked you about the <unk> think about the <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully dramatic environment for those bacteria.
It is warm dark -- it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all of the nutrients that they want to want to want to have no effort in their own.
It is really like a fast pathway for bacteria with occasional disruption in any rush rush to the output.
But in the way, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help us digest nutrients from <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got it.
When I was just <unk> I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by <unk> and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental -- in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell is just <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters cells.
But when diarrheal organisms, things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the death of the death of the body enters the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death -- it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas 90 years.
And one night he hits his front door at night.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a gorgeous <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "This "I choose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target in the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to make it healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about going through the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I'm kind of like <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think all of the feeling that he expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to make immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily apply to longevity.
They don't necessarily react to the biggest or the stronger or the faster and the faster and even the smarter.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only time of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there <unk> fish in the <unk> yet they've managed to make that an <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution, and if we look at the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if you look forward to the <unk> phase I would say there are many possibilities.
The first is that it doesn't <unk>
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking is that through medicine, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and passed away from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, you know, <unk> <unk> and we become so much not possible to have the necessary isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is that you produce an evolution of the natural kind of traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as a species of <unk> planets are going to be able to have the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility, a <unk> <unk> intriguing possibility.
I call it the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First of all, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it is what it does to the individual and family level.
Just think that if it could be able to choose not only to choose not only sex in their own body -- but in your own body to cure or preventing disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or <unk> the risk of cancer or <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your genes.
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
By the next year I had finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a close cost to 20,000 dollars and in a week.
Not very much to make the human genome actually make the human genome and be more and more and more and more at all.
These changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can do viruses that are not just going to protect ourselves from themselves, but they will induce herd immunity.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against flu <unk> in cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good about the <unk>
That's reality today, and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or changing the newborn <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthier life to remove the diabetes, eliminating the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same technology, <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to be able to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the <unk> of one Ken <unk> especially if you could be able to deal with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why would not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years ago, and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happened within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these options in <unk> from a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
We're going to build a society which is more boring and more robust or more robust or more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything: we're going to be able to develop wisdom and <unk> the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds scary.
Well, I had a single seat that day. It was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight flight.
So I immediately looked at it, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three minutes later happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the way.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The first three words have heard of.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes at a moment.
We have this list of things to do before they died, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and did it, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up a phrase, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to do anything in my life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot of -- I thought about, Wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also took place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I would argue about things that didn't care about people who matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels about <unk>
I'm not trying to be <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the sense of, Wow, they don't fear fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in one thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --  And I scream, <unk> as a kid.
And for me, that was all the reason for the world.
At that point I understood when we connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal that I have in life is to be a great father.
I became a miracle, not dying that day.
And I was assigned to give me another gift that it was the ability to look at the future and come back in another way.
You know, you're flying today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please be not like that -- but imagine, and how to <unk>
What are you going to say that they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents that we have.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in the life with many different projects.
But the biggest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day came to her house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, <unk> has total <unk>
It can only use your eyes.
Her job influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation design so that, obviously, graffiti is a intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and his cause.
So I went and I met her brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second second, it's not that you could see Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate by those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important and having a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie <unk> and <unk>
They communicate in that way, are going <unk> with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I introduced myself to the only desire to deliver a check, and instead he signed a check that I didn't have the least idea how I was going to <unk>
I teamed up with her brother and her father there at the very very moment, "All right, is the Tony <unk> going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to get it back again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has both in your interior can't be <unk>
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project one light on any surface and then with a laser pulse, you draw over that and register the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of a lot to move the things back to another one we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of the insurance companies and we got a machine to make it <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "You don't know. This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers around the world <unk> from every single corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something totally stupid and that when they did, they would have taken off the walls of the walls and their place would have been <unk>
But for two weeks, we went down to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog -- and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
This is a couple of cheap sun glasses that we bought in the round of <unk> Beach, some copper wire.
We take a <unk> camera, we put it on a light of LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and you build one, we published the <unk> <unk> the software becomes free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There's no hospital that can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And then more than a year of planning -- two weeks of books, of the entire night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot of the hospital.
And he came back to draw his family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and he would take me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
That's our scream at a certain way.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go down with this.
It's a great device -- but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we are trying to figure out how to go and make it faster and cheaper.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
Everything comes out of our pockets.
The prizes were from the guy, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the most largest inventions in 2010, and it was really great.
The best thing -- and this is what ends up from close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of the L.A. center at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> it's going to have the best <unk> of the urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible -- do it possible.
None of what you have in this room was possible -- the computer stage, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I have never done anything with <unk> <unk> I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel that we need to do. If it's not now, <unk> -- and if I'm not me, who was the <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations in situations that are generally very difficult and at the same time as much dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
It comes in <unk> and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating this fun at the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in great part of my career, I have been <unk> in situations in terms of the only goal to try and examine social issues in ways that we have a lot of social issues -- and hopefully analyzing a way that you see useful, and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights to the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I was doing was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it's about and depending on content that might be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said that, it's a very good <unk> opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I didn't have been able to do it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the world of marketing, <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten into horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could get me -- nothing could be <unk> for something that is so difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that I'm about <unk> and marketing and advertising, and that all film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to be called "The largest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top up at the end of the end, it has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that comes before the title title, the <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> A <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> It was just more for <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X X in the title but we're going to make sure we will make all the categories that we could on the film.
Maybe you get a shoe, and it gets the most cool shoe that you've got <unk>
The most cool car that you've driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink that you saw <unk> <unk> of "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> and we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film <unk> is transparency.
You'll see all the process in this movie.
That is the complete idea, all the shot of principle to end.
And I would love to help us make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half a half and a half <unk> -- John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to be a meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth to convince a couple of big languages.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out to us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think it's going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard for <unk> for the film or being I?
JK: So two things.
MS: And it means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And this was one for one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised to me.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today is this intersection of new media and old media scenario -- it's not the idea to have that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a mistake -- and that mistake was this.
It was actually not such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that showed up.
I like you to <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> that are characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in the practical practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the president, <unk> even <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to it, it really changes very suddenly.
But why? Well, the transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that still keeps <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to the companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want you to be able to tell you, <unk> history.
We want you to make a story -- but we want to make a story, but we have <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father gave me up in some lie -- and there he is him looking at it as a <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in history.
It's your story, it's my story, and there's <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that only because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take away from the proxy and go to the companies I have all my team.
So what I started to figure out suddenly -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: So I have friends that make big, big, giant films and others that make small, independent films like mine.
And my friends who make movies of big Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the brands associated that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Okay, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to look at <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone can say, "You're good cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want you to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there it would offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> as <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for men as to <unk> solid, to <unk> to <unk>
That's the overall story.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
Let's get into the kind of little films that we <unk> are more well a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people to be the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you want to describe in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something audacious, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep you fresh <unk> with better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like the <unk> of the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, to people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do they define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like a good thing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess that the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, many gray colors, and things like this.
Usually I wear accessories.
Woman: If you were a brand, you could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of these, <unk> partly <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 3: I'm the kind of pet guy.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because it <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tom, but I often fell down at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that person's personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they surely could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar photo.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people do a way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That's the world that you think your world is the world that you're going to do, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work that you do.
All of those things come out and start in a place and in my case, and you start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: what's the next thing you want to talk about?
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: That's how I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like things. I like things that I like things.
A: Tell me about the <unk> to what do you do that?
What is the <unk> In what phase phase is you find now?
Why is it important? What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: thanks for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> A <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yes, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only be <unk> in one of their strong points or in the other time in focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to do -- and it's the <unk> nature to avoid the things that aren't <unk> they are afraid of fear, those elements, and you actually give them to be something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come from, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What is your <unk>
If someone asks you to get your identity for brand your brand, your personality personality would be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful to be playful being cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold like <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> magical or mystical <unk>
Or are you more of a <unk>
You're aware, sophisticated as <unk>
Are you <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Are you <unk> stable familiar, <unk> safe, <unk> or wise the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mainly because they would have no control of the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how this movie is now using MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain both for commercial marketing as a film.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising to open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
And we went to school districts that companies are getting to their way in schools with problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects in which I've had the biggest answer or that I've had more success are those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took out of their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no better interest in mind.
I'm going to treat you directly with an artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make the people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you gone? They did success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie came back in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is just covering a couple of weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press and TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's not in line. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has now started to win momentum.
And it's not bad because almost all of the agencies that we talk about to do with their customers not being a part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get people out of that is pushing people to failure.
I think when you train your employees in loss aversion it's preparing all your company for <unk> for rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to happen is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, we'll move forward, I think we have to give it a place to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to charge transparency.
Now more than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: That's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check in the name of the TED Development organization -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my care for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes do not use <unk> software -- are of a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put a effective virus on Windows in a portable computer being used by an engineer to set up this gray, box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enters the grey box, damages <unk> and nuclear program is <unk> <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started investigating <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> I used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these boxes -- these control systems.
So that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we were looking at our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they had very strange things.
<unk> <unk> as a laboratory rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect it's actually working on that place: <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
So better than we would take the goal out.
So we pulled up and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> <unk> a little bit of a big.
We also saw that they were very professionally <unk> people who obviously had all the internal information.
<unk> all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much we did the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15 thousand code.
It looks pretty much like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to do it with the real world, with potential goals in the real world.
We need theories about getting us to pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find a number of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I asked them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that mobile part inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly be <unk> and even <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in one obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started investigating scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And he got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what do we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in my hands.
So I didn't have <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been made after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in dead ends.
Yet we found that both digital <unk> pointed to one and the same goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> small is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we are very confident that we have determined what <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I really did.
There's the grey box, and the top is the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the entry input values for example, of the pressure sensors and the sensors of vibration and provides <unk> <unk> which is still running during attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed by <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine goes from speed, you have to open escape tubes in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can explode.
And the <unk> or the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk> factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms for <unk>
It will be <unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what we're doing is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with great numbers of goals.
We need to face the consequences and better than we start to make now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has done public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower behind this.
There's one itself, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to be able to take and give you the <unk> abilities or another one that makes up the wheelchair users get up and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that goes in in the morning, gives you a great force that you can also increase your speed, and help for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connected with the universe and other things that are <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
To show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take over your back a load of 45 pounds, and it's being <unk> to take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with <unk> <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can get it 90 pounds for a number of things for many hours.
Their flexible design, allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running moves with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it rises my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's look back now to the users of <unk> about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people out there on <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a very conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, people with damage in the column that when they start their life -- at the 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that develops it up very quickly.
Their only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so for the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter of mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19, he had a injury in the <unk> column and as a result could not go back for 19 years old, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that they send signals to the computer computer here on the back.
There are also a few batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they do it with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a strange leap in the air, skiing down <unk> <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost a whole feeling and all of the movement of <unk> down.
Little time later, a doctor came into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never come to <unk>
That happened was 19 years ago.
So he stole me until the last few hope of my self.
<unk> technology has enabled me to learn how to <unk> it costs on <unk> and rocks and even ride with rocks and <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: So you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change your life to future generations -- not only of soldiers, but this and all the users of chairs of wheels, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I've just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hi, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is a serious thing.
And no, it's not the New Yorker festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, to meet their cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos of the rainforests in the Congo.
The Bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their living relatives, rather high.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done a lot of emphasize how our narratives of human evolution.
But the Bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where mortal violence hasn't been <unk>
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest -- and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been prolonged for decades and caused nearly as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat trade and deforestation is making it not fill or a stadium with the Bonobos that are in the world -- and honestly, we're not even sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear laughter hidden hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have sex <unk> <unk> and <unk> to drive conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them, the game is critical to establish bonds and foster <unk>
And with him we learn <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game, Bonobo looks at the same <unk> roots, the dance and the human ritual,
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> <unk> game -- and I don't talk about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what she is doing.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "You have a <unk> of <unk>
Only I think in this case, he loves him, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as well as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because I think -- this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing things unusual to the game -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to say this is <unk> a young female who is playing with a <unk> water.
I think that like her, sometimes we play alone, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt it to a world that changes have to play.
But let's get the most of our brain ability.
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans -- life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be the least appropriate thing to play, you can be the most urgent moments of it.
So fellow primates, who will accept this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> and friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, I think, fires like a captain of the captain in a volunteer body.
And in our city, where volunteers are, a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer.
But even there was a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that no doubt went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she stood out in the rain, under a <unk> in her pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just arrived before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain and he asked her to go into and would save the dog owner of the house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, would have to tell the people who walked into a seed building to save a live building, just because I made it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get between the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I was hoping but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the fire firefighters that at that height had finished off the fire and walked into the front room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back through the ladder where I met my <unk> and the gorgeous dog at the front door.
I went from the house to the home owner of the house where, as I would expect, his trove was a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the house owner of <unk> for the brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she watched on the rest of it was that someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both of my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as stealing <unk> I witness to the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or they are by -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: I don't know.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a park in the neighborhood.
They are mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's lives, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, he comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I am a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea of a fixed measure that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
A hundred years later, in 1947, in 1947, it came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> brick came to all the home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 miles per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a <unk> <unk> world to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block the transistor allows you to create much larger circuits and more complex, a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't know that the building blocks of our time are fitting to the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best of everything is that they join magnets up.
So you can't put it wrong.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the stream, the pink is the stream, the pink is the <unk> and the orange is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue one with a green one, and very quickly you can start making bigger circuits.
A blue one with one green one is producing light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, of pulse, that's here, and now we have a light <unk>
And we would take this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a machine machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having a program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using a very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or slower <unk> it just looks like this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growing.
We want all the interactions in the world <unk> ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We've given <unk> kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light of night, or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design design schools.
So, for example, designers without experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles, we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we brought the designers from the Island School of Rhode Island, who have no experience in engineering, just in wood and wood and paper and said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done a project that have done, a <unk> <unk>
But hang on, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these people, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go to the website, you can download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is trying to engage with the environment in focusing on the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
We can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology.
Oh, I mean the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk> to <unk>
<unk> some members every year and we put them out with the <unk>
Instead of <unk> the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They did great <unk> worked with <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
And this is a seat in Boston.
Here it comes up as if I would find a quote, but what it really looks for is that someone has clean up when you get caught by snow, because he knows it's not very good at putting fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for aid in this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time I was going to spend a lot of last year.
They realized the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else -- that the citizens of <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application in which you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you did, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a component uprising.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 apps last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it extends <unk>
A responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this app realized that I could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to embrace <unk> <unk>
It's very important that they work these <unk> of tsunami, but people <unk> the batteries.
So that's why the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that are going to use using it.
And this has been spread <unk> in organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology will know that this doesn't happen yet.
The acquisition of software is usually a couple of years.
In Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two months and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
We then told us that they had done for the normal channels would have taken at least two and two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the California court power -- so far two million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there's projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows in a couple of days and it spreads in viral form is a kind of shot of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the best way to work, not like in private companies as a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way to address the issue of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we were building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country who support their apps in their own communities.
They haven't been given up with the government.
Do you feel a great frustration in front of it, but they wouldn't be <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And it is that if we leave side of the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that they put around us crazy -- the government is basically in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they're not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
<unk> policy is not <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately arise from -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way we produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of healthcare.
It's the place that runs the calls if you mark it in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. He started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music hard and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston does not have a call center.
It has a <unk> and a mobile phone called <unk> <unk>
They didn't get that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City <unk> in Boston.
One day, this is really, actually got this <unk> <unk> in my trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went up to the place, I found the Rubik's cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good night, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical thing.
And it's also a great example of the government in the government to private volunteer exploration.
But it's also a big example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get together and help others.
So, an citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
<unk> the two people.
And it could have connected with the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, we will save the communities.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think it's the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is a vote.
How many times have picked up a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will save our values and make our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
So underneath it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what holds up with that that belongs to what that is happening in our against, that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because it's where the real work of government happens.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes <unk> movement.
Have you been <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed set of 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> of <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not a political activism -- it's a activism <unk>
And for those of us who are faced with government, it's time for us to ask ourselves what world we want to leave to our kids.
You have to see the big challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do it for government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root of the government so that it can spread <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, <unk> I'm a generation greater than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who goes to <unk> they're all going to speak.
They can express their opinions at any channel, and they do it.
So when they face the government problem doesn't care much to be able to hear their voices.
They're using your hands.
They set out the work to program applications that make the government better.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> by taking out <unk> casting a garbage bucket that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that; we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd, or we will be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons, jails and death row.
I have spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that wouldn't have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk>
Here's a fantastic presentations here.
And I think we have learned that the words of a teacher may have a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, they can have a special significance of meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my work.
I learned him from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in the entire family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was a <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and looked at it, she was approaching me and give me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> he was approaching me and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him that no, I got back again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that makes you always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to get his time and his attention.
My cousins was running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight, nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought I was a game.
And then I looked at him and he said, but she was very serious.
After 15 -- 20 minutes, she got up and she stood up in my room and he said, "Come on <unk> We are both going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you to <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "You know, <unk> I don't know. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you do?"
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "I just want you to get <unk> three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "Well, first I want you to tell me is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that I was always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> like this <unk>
And then he said, "Do the second thing I want you to tell me, is that you will always do the right thing right though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> This is <unk>
And then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that I was never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> like this.
I grew up in the field, in the south <unk> I have a brother older and sister a year.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and went for the forest.
We just get <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and you always do the same thing as we are.
I took something, your sister as well -- <unk> a <unk>
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And he looked at me with strength and <unk> "Ah, it's not going to be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is going to be <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I say it by the power that the identity is about.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that really doesn't make sense of it.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe to be able to do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believe that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My girls died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that it was, according to it, and we had to do it.
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people on parole.
And this mass <unk> in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, it's so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in prison or <unk>
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Philadelphia, Baltimore Baltimore, Washington, 60 to 60 percent of all young people are in prison or <unk>
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, also is about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is affecting the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not ours.
We're <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work -- some really curious things.
In my state, in Alabama, as in other states, you give you rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, <unk> male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it in the next 10 years the level of copyright loss will be as high as it was before it was before it <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
A lot of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was sentence for 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison country, no chance of getting out there.
Right now, we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, they've been asked to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
Of every nine people -- they have identified one that is innocent as <unk> and liberated from the death row.
A rate of error, <unk> an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation would not be allowed to fly airplanes if every nine that <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history, I talk about slavery to them.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to the Second World War.
Really, we don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are bigger people who come to me and tell me, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches of talks, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history, we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of racial and of separation.
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we were doing with each other.
We are constantly creating tensions and conflict.
We need to work out to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage you with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people were understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death penalty rates.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's well worrying about listening to what they <unk>
<unk> "We have no death penalty in Germany.
We will never be here."
The room was silent, and a lady said, "There's no way to our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational to us, <unk> and <unk> we put it to <unk>
So let's think about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, contributed to people, especially if they were in their <unk>
We couldn't get it off.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
And lately we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more <unk> to the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that will never come to TED.
To think of them is, in some ways, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual age.
And innovation, with creativity comes out not just of brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just as bright and <unk> but as dark and hard as well.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a willingness to be in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I believe, that even in communities like TED, it must be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to truly be truly humans if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, the injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer of meeting Rosa <unk>
These women were just together, just to speak.
Occasionally, <unk> lady called me to me to say, <unk> comes the <unk> We are going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I would say, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she would say, "Well, what are you going to do when I <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And in one occasion, I was there listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks ran to me and said, "Now, give me this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give you my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for the kids.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
And I gave it all my best speech and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that moment, Mrs. <unk> <unk> put my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to tackle those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lying, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't blame you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's right.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is about justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> they won't judge us by our technology, by our design and our intellectual ability or rational.
By the end of the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way that they treat rich and powerful <unk> but in the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond me in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were told to be told as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone in which it's not it?
The judge <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night I was awake -- I was awake -- my God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 year-old client -- a little, black poor, black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my black client in 14 years to be treated as a privileged white white <unk> of a <unk>
In <unk> I put that there had been a behavioral behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how this country is there is no ethical and a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, there was not only <unk> but he had sent the cut.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I was on the car court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came from the car. He walked into court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who are you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> "It's you. I said yes.
So I came up with me and <unk>
And I got rid of the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I entered the room for audiences.
When they arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> And we started going forward.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the guy who had written those <unk>
They got the policemen the prosecutors <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, I didn't know how, the room was full of people -- all because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye of the eye I went to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
And he looked down the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
They were walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black black, I entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break for a <unk> I showed you know, because the <unk> had entered in the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black guy stood up and looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this young audiences to tell this young man to keep her sight in the target with <unk>
I have come to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds towards justice.
That we cannot be truly <unk> if we don't care about human rights and dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity must be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an answer to the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There's a lot of opportunities to close it.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort for <unk> the funds that are spending today in punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death penalty in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases didn't be <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes come to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law, the law to the security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
And part of the explanation, it tells you that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you who you think is that?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> chain by stealing a bicycle, for small crimes, rather than making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've got to be <unk> here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the press means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second day, our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to survive, the first stop ever -- is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the <unk>
<unk> and <unk> all the information for something in the environment that could be able to harm.
And so from a <unk> of stories of stories will look at the negative.
That old saying of <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us positive news, seven days on the week, 24 hours a day, is not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be <unk>
But maybe it doesn't.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems problems, the climate change, the <unk> of water and <unk> and <unk> we have.
As human beings are really good at the problems and in the long time, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> per capita income per capita income has been <unk> across the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy was 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we keep <unk> expectations more and higher expectations.
In fact, it <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, great part of the people living under the line of poverty have electricity, toilets, <unk> television, mobile phones, conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So a lot of this is the technology and <unk> its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and double the price of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
And so the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession, in depression and <unk>
It is the resulting computer that we used to build computers faster.
It doesn't stop before any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
<unk> in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing, sensors and networks, the robotics, and your ability to democratize and distribute personalized production, all over the planet, synthetic biology, and the fuels and food, the food, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" Watson, from <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each <unk> of the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that <unk> and make it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> of the 1800.
He's the kind of the left.
Do you go to dinner the king of <unk>
The hyena troops had covered in silver, and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, that was more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the Washington Washington is <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like <unk> <unk>
It's tied through oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made the aluminum thing so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet that are going on for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about probability but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent of the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. <unk> parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have plenty of water.
Let's talk about the wars for water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager Voyager spaceship to the Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
<unk> a famous picture, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent.
Yes, <unk> is water water, and two percent is ice, and we fight for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology that's available not 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes from nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator <unk>
It's able to produce a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any fresh source water -- by less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just knew that I'm going to do a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an amazing innovation by this technology that exists today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better communications communication in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to have a smart mobile phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton was 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have happened.
better than that, the things that you and I have paid for tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video, video libraries of books and music, technology -- diagnostic technology now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes to when the applications are going to come.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation -- something called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the equipment in the world so that we get these technologies into a mobile device that you talk about, and because it has <unk> you can get blood out of your finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this device is <unk> a RNA virus, or DNA that would not be able to call the health store and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just have to go through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to provide the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds have never been before you get to the global conversation.
What would these guys want these people?
What would you do? What <unk>
And instead of economic collapse, we will have the highest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health because of the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of impressions in 3D, and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we deliver 3,000 million more members of humanity, healthy educated and <unk>
How about voices never before <unk>
So what if we give them the prisoners, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and power to act for the first time?
What do you do? These three billion?
And if they're the contributions that we can't <unk>
Something that I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams guided by their passion with a question of course, can do things -- things that could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played this with college teachers among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it's been shown that the machinery of human patterns of human patterns is better <unk> proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three million new minds that are being moved to us to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very powerful idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have any special special things.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they follow <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a fall in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a few <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 millimeters -- the <unk> of black length.
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was getting more than the middle in Ghana.
When I was there 27 years later, the number of fish had dropped to half.
<unk> the five inches.
We have a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> he started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose out to the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this boat, pretty ugly, it was called <unk> 4.
I went out to fishing in it, and we took studies in the southern Sea Sea Sea and, especially in the Ross Sea.
What we captured we captured was something <unk>
<unk> now -- the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are at the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny little <unk> of the remains that are fish reef.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very quick.
In a year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing and then start the commercial fishing set.
The bottom goes from being a solid background of coral reefs in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Don't <unk> the <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect every time they go to a place where they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We got the world, but we don't remember.
I would take the start of start to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the x-axis, we have things that are <unk> biodiversity, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the diversity of changes.
And at the end of the end, they keep <unk> remains.
And that, in large measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very prevalent before <unk> it's <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose small animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea of big fish.
They become a little bit frequent because the <unk>
You get a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect to have evidence.
So for example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> as a captain such as a captain looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or, usually they don't use the <unk> of the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From the huge paper that can be a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really recreated the past.
And the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has been run and it's very low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that they can erase their point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the Midwest, for example?
I think there are the arts and cinema maybe you can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay
A long time ago there were gray whales in the Bay Bay Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you deal with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to Cameron -- to make <unk> <unk> under the water.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube videos.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why videos are made viral and what's important about it.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or of our actions, copper predicated on a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, only one little percentage is viral -- gets lots of views and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and <unk> communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this shot shot outside his house in the National Park of <unk>
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of popularity of last summer.
<unk> didn't mean to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called Mountain Mountain <unk>
He had already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> He published this <unk> that I would get to the <unk>
The benefits of trends like Jimmy <unk> have present things and interesting things and <unk> them into a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to get on the end of week, the weekend.   You all want to come up on the end of week, the weekend.  KA: Don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day on Friday <unk>
Well, it took <unk> and many blogs started to write about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to do a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators of trends embrace a view of view and share with a broader audience -- accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who shares this big joke internal plate, then starts talking about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century entertainment century, this community engagement is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation -- with a <unk> music.
That's the way, that's it.
This year saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there is a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats watching the video.
But what's important here is creativity I woke up between the Internet <unk>
There was <unk>
Somebody made an version of the old one.
And then they became international it.
All of a sudden, there was a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we all can form together.
Because today it's not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca or Black or <unk> <unk>
What do you script might have been written that <unk> this situation?
In a world in which you get two days of video a minute, only the only thing and unexpected can be able to figure out the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who ran against the <unk> to <unk> in New York City, I admit I didn't get interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by the <unk> but we often have obstacles that prevent you out to be able to circulate them properly <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise of the surprise and your humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million watching and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth about all the new thing we do in creative form.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators for higher communities in participation, and the very unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- that we all have access and is the audience that defines fear.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
We didn't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of old media features -- it's hardly the current media features -- but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the parts.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a man whose whole life had been supported by the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been totally <unk>
And the words for so long friends, I would have this <unk>
They were <unk> in silence.
He died by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that history tried to be <unk> but I was doing it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat <unk> <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> and two little girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task to escape her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And then from a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat tied up to the sea as a boat turned into the <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear were the advertising, the rape and death.
As most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we got older, we first took my sister and I, and then she and she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rhythm of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I remember the lights from the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, end the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I did, given by the men of the platform.
No apple had ever had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrants from immigrants from.
Unlike the middle of the middle class of middle class, whose existence was <unk> there was no sense of right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car line, working six days, double turn.
Even so, I found time to study English and get a title in IT for the <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and they had an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, it wouldn't mind what it was supposed to be, which was generally <unk> <unk> was always a second hand.
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back again.
At home, where?
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we went on on our day and <unk> the motions of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares could be able to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> <unk> and <unk> boys and <unk> in between two worlds.
They looked at subsidies and <unk>
And they had the centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was a classic classical student with what I <unk> from myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in life -- tragically tragically, by violence, abuse, abuse and insulation.
But a lot of received help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I was elected the young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but their edges, not <unk>
So <unk> <unk> resident was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would have ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> about the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age that she had when she got up the ship.
It had never been a choice.
<unk> he said, "What don't you <unk>
So I talked about <unk> <unk> and education and <unk> the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly talking, I was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths of life, many of them doing what they were doing in the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a heart race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, a <unk> new at the scene -- and not only is that it is something that being grateful, perhaps a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my happy place to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that would not have been <unk> it was <unk>
There was a power there, a optimism -- a <unk> mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people who the motto cannot be <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant soup of soup, that all <unk>
<unk> at good entry at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones, and we opened up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a trip.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before the end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared for.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
On 17 became a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, it caused a <unk> to <unk> and take the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
It can't be done proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure we were still with it.
At night, a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Don't have a <unk>
If there's a family in our family, that runs through women.
Because of those who were and how life built us, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might want that to you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, you can give you brave on every wave, the constant rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see them safe, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians want to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when I was <unk> the great Indian warrior -- I was <unk> to produce a bow and a <unk> to the ground, she got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that's a lot of it.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get it to my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic, not <unk>
As my grandfather gave me his grandfather a silver silver <unk>
And this part of 50 years was to my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had the sense that mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them in that <unk>
We have our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how to use magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device able to connect to the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book out.
Where we are.
<unk> the text with this image, sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do you do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In a number of times, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live to the GPS -- that comes led to me.
My little girl inside all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that I <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always gave me exciting.
So over here, we have to change the iPad to release the fireflies.
And, indeed, you light your way in the rest of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every single world becomes a <unk> that I move to this magic device within the device.
And this opens a map.
In every computer book, there's always been maps but there's static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
I'm going to go in.
Another hugely important aspect to me is to create Indian content and the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra over years, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> to their <unk> not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out onto the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter -- a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside the variations of the connection between magic, the Earth and technology is many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction in which you go out with the iPad and video turned on, and through augmented reality you see a group of cartoons that appear on the interior plants in the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves the screen.
And you have to do the sound of wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to go to a world where the forces of nature is <unk> with technology and the magic and technology and technology are coming to each other.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves in the natural world and to that magic, joy and love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about why a lot of <unk> <unk> projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a conductor of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what everybody, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail, because we stopped listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob on it on and on.
Every morning I was shocked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him too. So he can see what my problem is my weight problem, not at the same time where it needs <unk> assistance or any urgency of that style but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have over 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale, and before you get up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week we're going to be available from the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people were going to take them from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, get to <unk> control and to be captains of their own <unk> but also it can help care of health care because of the challenges we face, as the firing of the costs of attention, <unk> the demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like these, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share it with you with a video video.
We all have checks in <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where the <unk> machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this time.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public audience -- you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes they open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> were already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and then the next few weeks will use your phone phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we'd like to give them globally.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us to find, work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> across the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody else -- can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> is still in its place.
Please go through this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share the <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
And I mixed with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera, the process ends up when the <unk> is <unk>
To me, photography had more than to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that started by press the <unk>
<unk> like this one, a building in a very <unk> road.
But it has a twist on it.
And even though it holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful aim at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the flu level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want to look like it seems to be captured in a way like photograph.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem <unk>
They're the details or <unk>
Put the light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how can you perceive in a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way they can create something that still seems to be <unk> as if they were there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's turn into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture seems like a picture of realistic I think they are those in which we don't even get the things around us in our everyday life.
But when we combine photographs is very important -- because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures <unk> have to have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make you impossible to distinguish the principle and end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
And so I think it's easier to create a place that you find is because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that has in your head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew I had several months to figure out the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
<unk> are from a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even made a red house the top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome I think it needs to be planning for planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the pictures that the result can be very beautiful, and it can be very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing a slide of technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram any one that took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like a lot of other things that we usually see, is kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is a novel thing.
Here's something weird.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn into the lights.
It was more intensity because I write about paper.
Why would we make technology curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw it on a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to look at the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you go for example, some other technology, like transport, on a curved curve, it would be very dumb, we see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transport technology will be as fast as the past <unk> we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go down to that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of the technological development of an <unk> that every few years shifting orders of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is to look at these <unk> curves we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
They were going to take one of two things.
Or it will be converted into a typical <unk> curve.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, that's why I think maybe something like this.
It would be in the middle of a transition now.
In this line we're in a transition from what it used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, is what is that new way you adopt the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember a child in the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
That happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to tell you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking away and look at things over the long term.
The scale of time where I'd like to do this is time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back a couple of two and a half thousand years ago when the Earth was a big rock with lots of chemicals that would spread around it.
If we look at the way that chemicals organized the chemicals we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that's that, at that time, there was a little bit of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet had had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate out of the outside of the outside and the drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those drops weren't alive, in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> <unk> a distribution of the chemicals that we have.
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that in some way are going to be better at the way to incorporate the chemists <unk> <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
They usually lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life, very simple chemistry, but things become interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, we would argue, in this meaningless evolution of <unk> a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to be able to do it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained completely stable since it evolved 2.5 billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every single living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here's a hundred <unk> white dust that I try to hide the security security workers.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it was <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all of the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus, and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy, another billion years ago.
But then another big step happened in which things were very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information in the cells in the cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, we evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and a <unk>
So you know, <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community would become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe from the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years ago.
And at that stage, we have communities -- communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or from the brain, or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these began to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more that process in community.
It's the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process information that those cell phones built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey the information.
Those were brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them a evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time period of evolutionary time.
So a organism could, for example, learn to not eat a certain fruit because she knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these structures of information processing that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that ate that fruit together.
So the fact that the nervous system built these information structures actually accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals found the communication trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is the human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated -- we turn it into sound, in sound sequences -- and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
So that lets us start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do <unk>
Now we went through periods similar to <unk> organisms -- <unk> our <unk> presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the video tape, <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us together in something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which we had a certain evolution with the program <unk> in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years of each other.
The next few stages the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> and language, and they took less than a million years.
And beyond, like electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess it's the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I get my life to design computers, and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would not be possible without the recent academic advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine with that does something that they didn't do, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes we use methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method, I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
So we put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of art.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions <unk>
You could run these <unk> instructions sequences at random, running all of those programs, and take those who are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to <unk> numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But once he was able to find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now I'm going to get the ones that better <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs that <unk> children, which <unk> <unk> and the children will get the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that had a little bit more success.
And we say, "Please, repeat the <unk>
Let's try it again.
<unk> some mutations <unk>
And it tries to bring it back and forth with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes -- or in complex cases in a little bit of complex cases, in a few ways.
In the end, we ended up with programs that orders very perfect <unk>
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to hear them about how they work.
These are dark and very strangers.
But they meet <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety of getting the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
One time I was going into a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and he says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to do very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at a time analog to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now it comes the lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give up a part of my false <unk>
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm focusing on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about 300 of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and anyone who is trying to <unk> the first base of it not reach for time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know what they call a <unk> <unk> in the Big <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that is someone that you from 10 <unk> hit me.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the chief League of <unk> in a regular basis.
Now I'm going to take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have a <unk> and you have a surgeon who has a record for 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a remote place and dear to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor derived from a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But know what?
She's actually getting better dramatically better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask you.
What do you think must be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, <unk>
And the truth of the issue is that no one in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, however, is sending them to the world, and I was included, with the line of being perfect.
That never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the take-home message when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman studying up to a blood test.
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent <unk> diagnostic and not standard.
And I even knew the partial diagnosis about how to rank <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as they get more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you were to take everything, then you would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because this is what I'm going to tell me of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought her lunch lady to the emergency service where I worked.
At that time I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when I was able to meet a cardiologist to go to a cardiologist played me to that patient.
And to inform the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which <unk> a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart is going to work and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, they filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I would love him.
I gave it <unk> and medication to ease the pressure on his heart.
I gave it <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I was very good.
And it was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the Chief <unk>
I didn't get the phone, and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, it would have been able to bring information out of it.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that is constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send her home, he didn't take attention to a voice in my interior that said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so confident that until I asked the nurse that I would say to the nurse to <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to their <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was <unk> and the ambulance along the ambulance with the ambulance they took her to his house.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, <unk>
But I went on with my work.
At the end of the day, I got to leave the hospital and walked down to the parking lot where my car was my car to go home. And I did something that I don't do normally, at that time.
I went through the emergency service service.
And there is another nurse, not the one that I <unk> from the lunch lady before, but another one, he told me three words, those three words that most of the medical doctors would have been born.
Other specialists who fear them as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
In an hour of time I had come to her house, after I would give him the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance who brought it to the emergency room with a blood pressure on 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a severe shock of <unk>
I was just breathing and blue.
The emergency staff would spread all their resources.
They gave them medication to get the blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and I was hoping against every hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that they never will.
He had a permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was going to be moved to what was happening.
And in ninth day, they left her to go. She said, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the next few weeks ago, I was excited about it, and I experienced it for the first time the embarrassment of shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt <unk> <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't touch it with your colleagues.
One makes peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
Shame is what I'm talking about is the one that makes us feel very wrong with it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt felt.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take the things and made sure that I didn't give up.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why was he sent to your house?
And in my worst <unk> why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose medicine?
<unk> that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in one day <unk> the sky opened up and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with with me in which if we put in the efforts to be perfect for making more mistakes, would make those voices <unk>
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it came back again.
Two years later, he was an <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
I was <unk> penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door, he followed his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> my head asked me to speak to me in his office.
And I gave the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in <unk>
He came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but it's going to cause the closing of those tracks.
He, fortunately, she didn't die.
You get antibiotics for <unk> and it's recovered by the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then <unk> and went back to work, until it happened and again and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the emergency turn of the emergency turn to the emergency turn of the <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were going to have 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculation <unk>
<unk> an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out a colleague of mine who was checking the patient <unk> some sensitivity in the bottom corner and I called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to get it.
I checked it and see a certain sensitivity in the lower law, I called a surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was <unk> I was shocked.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful people have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here is the problem: If I can't get my way back and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what happens, how can I be able to share this with my <unk>
How do I teach you this so they don't make the same <unk>
If I could go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- you might have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
This is the system where there are two <unk> who make mistakes and the ones that I don't have to sleep and the ones that I know; those who have <unk> results, and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I have done a personal <unk> personal study and medical mistakes to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto Star Toronto to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where errors are happening every day, in which one in 10 drugs are wrong, or <unk> is not right. In a system where <unk> infections are increasingly, and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they are dying 24 Canadian errors for medical errors.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going up every two or three years, and we didn't get them.
<unk> play is just the whole thing.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow for a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain, it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and <unk> and suddenly my story <unk> <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things that are always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals who are likely to do -- well, not being left.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their more <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art -- I would say to everybody, from the ambulance guys to the head of <unk> surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, blah, <unk> "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone towards them.
And their students were <unk> to go down to the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
They can say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, they accept it, they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but a loving way, and support for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes at the time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, <unk> errors <unk>
And I feel a lot of effort and effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people, and the average amount of choices that says to choose a half American American is about 70 to the day.
I didn't do a lot, in a research for a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks <unk> for these executives and the time that we want to make decisions related to these tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How does the way that deals with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to the <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
In other ways, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> at the very, very <unk> <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
It was about 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and some 25 of <unk> water and this was when we took water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was one occasion, I asked myself, why never buy nothing?
This is the shelf oil <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in box <unk> that came out of <unk> trees.
I decided I went to a manager and asked him, <unk> well this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists who came out every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
lobby.
They had <unk> different classes.
<unk> a <unk> at the entrance to the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop to test the <unk>
More people stopped when he had been <unk> a quarter that when there were only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
Who stopped when there was only three percent got to buy <unk>
So when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably think it's good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices affect us in good decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this doesn't be <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at decisions about savings for retirement for about a million Americans, in between <unk> plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of available funds available to retirement, the <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
And we found that the bigger the number of funds were <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about <unk> the rate of participation went to the '60s.
It turns out if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the more the number of choices, more people are being used by avoiding the actions or the hedge funds.
In terms of more choice, they were more willing to invest in financial <unk>
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we need to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three critical negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The more likely it is to be able to make the decision, even though this is against their own self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively it gets better.
The main reason is that we will be able to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations in order to contrast and choose from that stunning <unk>
Today I want to talk to you about four simple techniques that we've collected in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, which is less than that.
People are always annoyed when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're seeing is more and more is that if you choose to be able to be able to get rid of strange <unk> options, there will be an increase in the sales -- <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, you saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation Golden <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> increased <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and under costs.
You know that living today in average you have 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store, you have about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the current world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce in tin.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come up on how to handle the best of the best examples is the <unk> David <unk> <unk> program.
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a life fund of life.
Those who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how a <unk>
All of them are <unk>
The first thing I do is to ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, they can't be able to do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer the people in this audience on a holiday with all the paid road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a round of applause.
<unk> <unk> All right. Anybody who is ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really would hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first turn, than in the second time, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to manage the problem of <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be feeling very <unk> very <unk>
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or debit cards that when you use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to find more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being held in a <unk> plan.
And I was in that meeting that <unk> exactly like <unk> did a little <unk>
What we added was that we would give the staff to think about the positive things that they would have in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent of 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their own accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can drive more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a toy aisle in a classroom.
What we saw is that in the supermarket <unk> the length of the <unk> the computer show can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the classification tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk> examples.
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> to give you a <unk>
<unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> to give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This classification scheme is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to be able to say that they didn't get the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
I am supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if you just get it a little bit.
We need to increase adult complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a <unk> decision.
This is a car manufacturer that allows cars to be <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
I have color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is vary the order in which the decisions.
So half of customers are going to go out of many options, 56 colors, to some four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to do?"
What is that involved you are.
If you were <unk> you always have the defect in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button and again and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which the information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although we choose the box of changes does not say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've been talking about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> alternatives to make it <unk> <unk> we can drive more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity <unk>
All of these techniques that I've presented with were designed to help drive the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful to <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices can be able to practice art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> in the East Germany, I found out if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
So I had to register a blade of example of written by the machine.
And so the government could track the origin of texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't conceive of somebody who could do this, so much that it would make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up with a little print yellow dots on every page that follows a pattern that makes you yourself from one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are you the <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks for a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that we would take money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it for illegal media through the bank <unk> to steal money from our bills when we bought it in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought it on a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> that of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be <unk>
In the future, most crimes, most crimes, online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not really motivated by money.
There's another thing that moves, the protests, they motivate them to motivate them to motivate them to them.
groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a huge role in online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> the criminals who do it for money, <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the national and governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a authority of <unk> of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the <unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
They had the safety of the site and that creates a <unk>
Last week, I asked in a meeting with members of the Dutch government and asked one of the leaders if <unk> death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a heart attack.
<unk> is an authority <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What is the <unk>
Well, you need to have a website with <unk> services, services like <unk>
Except for a foreign killer authority.
And it will be <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt, the <unk> protesters <unk> the headquarters in April of 2011, and during the building, the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there was notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government for <unk> the communications of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspected in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the arguments online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like this obvious answer should be "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right now that we have to spend today, will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that we have to worry about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the southern Park of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, and the back of the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate to outside the park.
And predators, such as the lions, they go, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and as soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value it.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
They were dying are warriors who protect our community and cattle, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A child in my community, of six to the age of nine years old, is responsible for won his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions was afraid.
But I realized that actually, it didn't be <unk> because I even helped the lions to see the pen up away.
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions so they believed it was near <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.   They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on the turning of the lights out.
And this is a little lamp from a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load battery and battery <unk> electricity to the small box -- I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where lions.
And this is how they see lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the house houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
The <unk> you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now because of Kenya, to scare other predators as hyenas, <unk> and it's also being used for <unk> elephants as well.
And thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise funding and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community, and we installed lights in the houses that don't have it, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna -- the cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes that would someday be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture what exciting is to listen to a story like you.
So you've got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions in it.
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electric electric one. One near <unk>
<unk> I know that you already invented electric fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would give you a time once, right? and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I was trying to get a <unk>  CA: When I got out of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to <unk> in every single step that I had my friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would take all the time studying Kim <unk> story -- but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I'd happen all my life in North Korea, until everything changed <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That he said, "When I did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
One woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in his arms looking at his head of her mother and so I could do nothing.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine <unk> to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all my way around it was completely dark at night except for the lights in the sea in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, enabling North America to cross <unk>
But many of them die.
Sometimes it would see bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I went out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk> parents.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like a refugee camp.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was done, actually, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was <unk>
If it doesn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to wrap up.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another one, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are seeking in <unk> <unk>
But many can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Even though there were <unk> they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they are <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that the North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, everyone can be <unk> at a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I have decided to take it to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Pole.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even it went through a identity crisis.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I?
Suddenly, there was no country I could call with pride with me.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started to study to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had a little bit of money that sent to my family, and as punishment, my family was going to be shifted to force to a location from the <unk>
They had to run away from immediately immediately.
And so I started planning on how I could escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border to North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese -- I had to go back in a way, for more than three miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost went caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and approached by an Chinese police officer.
He asked you all of you and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I did.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money in order to bribe <unk> guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to go and came between the <unk> office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was to the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and another two North America and <unk>
I would take you with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind stranger <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to <unk> when they were doing it.
And he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people who are <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long trip, my family and I came together in South Korea, and I met in South Korea.
But to get their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in the English community, practices, of work, and more.
We can also act like a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us follow in touch with family still inside, and we sent information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North America -- all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Center.
This is Center at <unk> shops and <unk> food stores, <unk>
So the planners of the city came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles in the South, as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --  <unk> <unk> food, fast food.
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert -- Los Angeles Center, home to the food places to bring and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to lead more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
And I was trying to see that this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go from house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I saw <unk> wheels and sold as cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a forest forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet x 3 feet.
The point is, belongs to the city.
But you have to run it.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come in, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to do it out.
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> we get together and we started planting our forest of food, trees -- <unk> -- you know, nine fresh vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of paid <unk> <unk> made out of the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city came up and on top of it, and <unk> gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my backyard, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on, in right?
A judicial court for planting food in a piece of land that nobody would <unk>   So I was like, "Okay, <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
The L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
The L.A. city is the city of America with more <unk>
It's got 68 miles of <unk>
That's the equivalent of 20 <unk>
That's a space for planting <unk> million blood plants.
Why on earth does it not look like this?
Let's take a plant to a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar dollar would give you 75 dollars to give you.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Center.
I grew up there. Tell my children there.
I was going to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I built my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You get rid of what the Earth can do, if they let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education, transformation in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They were trying to see how they affect guys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
And you get <unk>
I remember once a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my backyard, I went out and looked very <unk>
I felt bad as they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes that people will steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh no, I'm not afraid you're going to <unk>
That's in the street.
That's what it's about.
What I want you to do is, but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another time that I put a garden in a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, and they helped me to download the truck.
It was great, and they shared their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant with his mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, they work and <unk> all of them in plan.
If kids grow <unk> the guys will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this will be told if you're not taught how the food affects your mind and your body, eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where you're sitting there in this way that you're sitting on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them anywhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these guys who are <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plan -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant all of a block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and convert it into a healthy <unk>
I don't know me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to try and work to people, getting the guys out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and honor of growing their own food, opening the farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script that's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I'm not called to me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come into the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably everybody will agree with me in which this is a very nice road.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material for drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
They can have a lot of water in the asphalt <unk>
And especially if you go from <unk> in your bike and these cars go -- that's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like the Netherlands, close to the cities, we would want a silent road.
The solution for that is to make roads on asphalt <unk>
The asphalt asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has <unk> and water can move through it, so all of the rain water flow over the sides and you will have a road because it's easy to drive, and not <unk> water never anymore.
Noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very hollow, all of the noise disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that it can be <unk>
What is <unk> See that on this road the stones on the surface would be <unk>
First of a stone, then several more and more and more, etc., and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's smart.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you're going to become <unk> and they will be separated from the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you will get the <unk> like we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel, from that to clean up, and we can cut the steel wool into very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat heat, especially steel, is very good at it.
So what you have to do is to heat up the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used an oven, <unk> because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 meters from the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road lasts last several years without any harm. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
So we made the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, and the ones then with our <unk> machine, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using fiber fibers bringing these fibers, using the power of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, and they can even double the life of the surface of the road, they actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity that this worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before I can show you how it acts on it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News BBC in his little gray radius.
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those time, because the news is generally <unk>
"The Taliban was <unk> screamed my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and they made that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a kid for <unk> to my older sister who could no longer be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could <unk>
Every day, we would make a path different so that nobody could suspect of where they would be.
We had to hide the books in the market bags so that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us left in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we were going to save our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school was suddenly suddenly suddenly for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you are."
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters was a <unk>
My grandfather was a remarkable man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, outside to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my educated mother became a master's degree.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our home home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not to educate their children.
And for the years of <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money. You can get them to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So you still want to do not <unk>
I have 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than school, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I meet here proud of graduate school in <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the who was <unk> from their home for the courage to educate their daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who carry it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> the first private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the very strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see her parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite the time in front of a <unk> opposition.
As <unk> It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and her daughter were going to come from the way from <unk> to his village, and literally, they were killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to her house, they are the phone, a voice told him that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> now, if you <unk> he said, "but you don't hurt the future of my daughter for your old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized, I think about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who have <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were to school have to lie in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S. here.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
And so we would argue that these changes didn't last long after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents that <unk> for them, I see a future <unk> and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> would give me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never have forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution as the <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and <unk> a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the <unk> <unk> every of the regime, carrying <unk> for freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you shown a copy of the <unk> <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west, up to the south.
Finally, after a six months of the brutal war and a few losses from about 50 thousand dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I've wanted to do with many other women, rebuild civil society and <unk> and a fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation and national Sea.
It became about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops on the development of capabilities, and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women, we founded <unk> of Women -- <unk> for the <unk> women's movement -- a lot to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right to participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period -- an environment that was getting more <unk> than <unk> from selfish policies and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was unanimously and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first choices in 52 years.
However, little enough, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> ancient and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American Ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the U.S. officials from the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations.
Our society, made by a competitive mindset, <unk> more, and it's become away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to deal with our history of the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
And I'm here today to argue that we, as a nation, we chose to make the wrong decision for it.
We don't prioritize good.
Because the choices they didn't brought peace, stability and security to Libya.
<unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination, and <unk> so much for men for women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the choices, that only <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the female representation of the female to need the <unk> and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as an outrage agents and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also to put the mercy in practice in place of society in place in the competition -- inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by war, desperately needs to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in a existential way, before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known for all of the <unk> traditions, has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that unfolds to all the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the towns have <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion makes all the existence.
This is what it tells us, "My mercy is <unk> all the things."
So it tells us "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
That would all be <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a glorious question: who has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that they all do -- why she is left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, or an expert on domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul, <unk> to me with a <unk> <unk> with bullets from <unk>
The man who loved more than no one in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a <unk> psychological trap where every year and millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list <unk> <unk> between them -- <unk> <unk> Leo <unk> and The Washington, <unk>
I have nearly 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the religions, all levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and long duration of the other way, in families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would be sitting with a man who was going on with a man who <unk> and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than other ages, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I didn't know anything about violence, or their warning signals or your patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, <unk> night of January.
I was sitting next to me in New York City, and he started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he also had a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what was most impressed by that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a kid in the field.
I had a few big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most smart things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it all over the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me: I loved all of me: I had gone to Harvard, that I would put passion in helping girls teenagers, and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why the bachelor's in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and her brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase of every relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York City and leaving my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I left my work and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling on a <unk> <unk> who was entering a head in a physical trap. financial and carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it is.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where they were supposed to be able to feel so safe to be bought three <unk>
One had in the <unk> of the car.
Another one kept the pillow under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns to cause the trauma that they lived with small.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and, although I never had lifted my hand, my life was already serious danger, every single day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven o'clock in the morning and he still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother's suit, and I married him.
Despite what happened, I was confident that I was living happy forever, because I loved him, and he loved a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was just very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
He had been an isolated accident, and I would never make it anymore.
I spent two times more in our moon of honey.
And the first time I was driving to a secret beach and I was <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back to our moon of honey was <unk> by traffic and threw a Big Mac Mac on the face.
<unk> he kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control argued that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had a very good company.
Going back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help us <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question everyone does is why it just does not be <unk>
Why didn't you <unk> I could have been at any time.
So for me this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we, the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of the mass violence in domestic violence occur after the victim has taken to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include a permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has become married, <unk> of financial resources, and the family court system in the family family to get to the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend time with the man who <unk> his mother.
And yet, we still keep asking why it just doesn't go down.
I was able to go to the cause of one last <unk> and up to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke silence.
I told everyone the world: the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, and I am here today because all of you will tell me.
We have the trend to <unk> victims like headlines like the headlines -- women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why are you <unk>
Some people is a way to say <unk> is her by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also <unk> who learned that they learned that they learned that they learned from what happened to their lives and happy lives as <unk> wives and mothers, lives entirely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
And I became marrying a man cute and <unk> and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to come back to have ever more, is a gun that is charged with my head in someone who says that I want.
At this moment, they are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now that they're being <unk> or they are <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting his daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> just thrives in silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They <unk> the <unk> to the light of it with their children, their classmates and family and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
They were going to make the light signs of violence to be intervening consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe way.
And together we can convert our bed, our tables and our families in the past, secure and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dress up like this.  Luckily, I've brought him clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to go to them now, but we find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These stood very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to go through this sweater, by the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it also <unk>
I've changed what I've thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer would tell me that I was going to get the back of my back, and I would get the hair out of the kid.
Of course, with surgery or a bit of artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful and white, woman, and in my labor sector, that's going to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed for <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape to <unk> and to a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've known to use to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now shown now -- and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> Hold on. There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York I told each and every single role models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people have always asked me is: can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know that.
But then what I would tell you every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you were the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, Cameron -- I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> <unk> of American magazine or the next Steven <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model that's like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike the <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you see your studies, and you have a copy of jobs on your backs, no matter what you do, you want to say -- if you pretend that you want to be president of the United States, but you get your <unk> <unk> of clothes inside 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always ask me is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
And this was the first picture that I got married, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time yet.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I'm at a <unk> party a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk> magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not myself in those pictures.
They are creations of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always asked to ask you, <unk> for free?
I have too many inches and I have never use, except the couple of earlier, but the privileges the privileges that I get to are the ones I get in the real life, and we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and they gave me free <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped on a red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> from these privileges for me, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the teenagers who stood up and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there's only <unk> young black and Latino young people in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times I get <unk> and <unk>
In researching this talk, I found out that the 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is, how is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you hope is, if you're a little thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe this is <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also amazing to be able to work with creative people, smart people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I have never said in front of them, is: I'm a insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with a little more thin legs and the hair I will be happier to be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> hair and the most brilliant hair and the <unk> but it's probably the most <unk> women on the planet.
But especially it was difficult to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that will retain from this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image in the perception that we have the success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was getting enough enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 photos more <unk> and I didn't go to the <unk>
There was no <unk> or <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a little bit <unk>
In fact, most of them get them removed at random.
My story begins when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter in the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
I thought we went back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take <unk> New York City on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists which was going to take us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and fortunately, never anybody has ever been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what I had happened that day that it would be a five year-old girl I could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of concrete or a specific journey.
It's also a way of stopping time in a week in October and we will think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because although we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how they perceive and interacts with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, it stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the baby store that <unk> from small in the previous article.
And it described to me what had felt like the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what he looks at in New York are universities, because he's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that pulls the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and I didn't go close to someone and asked, does it take us a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk>
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughter, like <unk> <unk> stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't hold clean up the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the World Bank -- where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 are facing a high risk of extinction.
So why are the ones that <unk> are important, first of all, they provide life ecological services.
They're our <unk> natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria. They help to absorb anthrax that would not be <unk> and caused great loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity <unk> and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and below Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> in places like Tibet, in Tibet, like Tibet, in Tibet -- there's no place to bury the dead or wood, so these <unk> provide a natural waste system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there's conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities, use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list of extinction, -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they fall out of the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a minds.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge amount of time <unk> to <unk> The number of research has increased greatly in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up the top of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Okay, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see they travel through different countries, so to focus on a city problem it's not going to serve anything.
We need to work with governments at the <unk>
We're working with the local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that are <unk>
How can you help? It can become active -- making noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you would tell you about the <unk> but they talk to your families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw it flying without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I run and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young man, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia. In projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all that we would expect, <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to growing food.
So we came up with seeds <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the <unk> River, and we teach local tomatoes and <unk> Italians and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were talking to them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't <unk>  We were amazed that the local people, in so fertile -- valley, they had no agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we were going to do anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa grew up <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato could grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.
And we couldn't believe that, we were telling them to <unk> Look at how easy it is <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red and the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> showed up from the river and ate it.  And we said to them, "Oh my God, <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought we only had the Italians -- mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans were doing -- what they were doing -- and then you see what they did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
So we will see the <unk>  <unk> seeing the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
You want to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western countries, we've introduced the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
They just read your book.
It was part of a African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> a <unk> romantic, and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root -- which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want a lot of a lot."
<unk> I try all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> themselves.
This should be the first beginning of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to say, 27 years only answering people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you can never help anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you? Do you <unk>
It would never come to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We came up with a cafe. We went together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you?
The passion that she has for his own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for once, they were <unk> but not in their bodies.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with their communities.
The entrepreneurs never come back, and they will never say, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance have been identified.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work in face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor in the business of the business, and the doctor of the <unk> in your coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this condescending junk where we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
Design is the kiss of death of the business of business.
So now we <unk> reconstructing <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to be able to make you <unk> privacy, you have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion?
What presentation are you going to get more <unk> this morning.
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that the <unk> spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first Industrial Revolution, fossils not renewable <unk> and at one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a nice story that I read in a journal magazine many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> met this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to <unk>
They were already being used by <unk>  so, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what's going on? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States <unk> anonymous companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very <unk> <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to give you a <unk>
Otherwise they will not come to talk with you.
Then, you have to give you an absolute <unk> dedicated <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smaller company, the largest company has to be able to do three things -- <unk> the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell you with a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, selling and search for money.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at them and looked at the 100 hundred companies of the British world, <unk> <unk> -- all new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: No one was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small <unk> environment in bars with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who speaks to you, what will you need?
What can you?
Well, you can <unk> You can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
We can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much people pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask and borrow more things without calling the door into a <unk>
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for cow stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
That always gives birth to music.  There's a <unk> in New York  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the highest number of abandoned <unk>
I live close to this house and I thought how could turn it into a more pleasant space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
Her death was suddenly sudden and unexpected it.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this gave me a profound amount of gratitude for the time and lived in the time.
It gave him clarity to the significant things of my life today.
But I was trying to keep this look in my daily life.
I think it's easy to be able to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends turned the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and he painted on her sentences for <unk> he stops <unk>
So, <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know how to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be <unk> by <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on <unk> on the line of <unk>
<unk> I want to sing for millions of people."
<unk> I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die I want to be <unk> once more."
<unk> I want to go to the rescue rescue.
I want to die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh laughing at me, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> It's about giving the reflection and <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and began to get hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit, and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions it is more important than ever ever, to find the ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is brief and <unk>
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that are going to become more power.
It's going to be thinking about death -- our life.
Our shared spaces, can reflect better what we care as individuals and as a community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single petition.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
And not speak, but transmits joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
It's shared. <unk> happen what happens happening.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice in this: it's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to say the words that I couldn't even <unk> it reminds me of one thing, how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> the <unk> memory.
However, it's an selective memory.
It doesn't remember if he stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year in which I went out of my iPod, conversation that we kept when I was four years old, I got to pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady Lady birthday.
It doesn't look like <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although it wouldn't consider it inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing -- which was <unk> autistic and extraordinary people.
Now, for those least familiar with the term <unk> is a brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, from there that <unk> be so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disorders that fastest in the world, there is no cause or cure <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that would have a <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature, a kid who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never seen.
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things I wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> passes through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any of you are wrong.
It only means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you, and you would be normal to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift in your interior and, honestly, the pursuit of normal is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time that we try to be like others.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me a teacher of communications that gave a kind of communication to students of engineering.
I was afraid.  <unk> of the <unk> of these students with their great minds, their big minds and their big <unk>
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> was supposed to have sense when he fell through the <unk> <unk> and saw the door of a new world.
Just as I sat when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience also this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to the health and care environment -- and if we don't know what we don't know about it, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please have <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and that its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that you see the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, carefully <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same as making them stupid things.
Instead, as Einstein, said it is all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate your science without to compromise ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they are ways of turning and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting your work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been asked by what they call <unk>  What do you make the <unk> the bullets are killed and kill their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's <unk> too much in the language of our brain and <unk>
In contrast, this example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase -- <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then we can provide graphs that we prescribe to our other senses and they create a more profound sense of understanding what they would be.
I think these are just some key keys that can help the other open the door and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all of the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of the Oxford English Oxford is <unk>
Just because it sounds great.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that defined much better when he said, "A <unk> is that looking for a public charge -- no matter of course, <unk> or that, when he wins, you get it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They brought him in the Tower of London, and he was <unk> but he had enough courage enough to deal with them, and at the end, he had such a popular support in London that won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's a literal thing.
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to tackle the question of how to call George Washington, the leader.
They didn't know it.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They introduced all kinds of suggestions that might have been <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> of <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was about tested quality.
And not even with it were <unk> they had the idea that you could have King King of a given day.
And there might be <unk>
Everyone got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be able to control power.
They didn't want to call him King if it did not give him to him or his following ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and <unk> that came to them.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was only before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I had no more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a stupid title.
And so the Senate was <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who is going to do with a very ridiculous title and <unk> as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't happen.
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk> the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to keep there, waiting for the Senate between in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we will stay waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- I want to tell you, is that the title of President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of inland <unk> and so on.
The reality and history has endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern in the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was a <unk> then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has five nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives is because no one is going to feel like they are now going to be the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and I would like to give you to you.
Politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but actually actually change the words much more the words that they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to <unk> in a illegal mine in Ghana.
<unk> is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but most of all, that cacophony of male <unk> and stones are very primitive.
As others -- I carry a cheap <unk> of light that holds the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days earlier, that he lost the control and he fell <unk> feet on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the depths of that hole, and your lives without paying a reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they probably never will. Because they're prey of slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the Peace Summit <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there was I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO who has to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not that grade.
When we finished talking to me, I was very excited about ignoring this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, it had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are currently over 27 million people in the world.
Is it twice as much of the number of Africans displaced for all of this slaves <unk>
150 years ago the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about <unk> 6,000 people today.
However, you can afford entire families and entire families for <unk> dollars for 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from over <unk> 13 billion a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to find that they are forced to work without pay, under threat of violence and can't escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
Poetry exists in almost everyone and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and ideal show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at the temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- entire families -- <unk> <unk> in their heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> furnaces to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, nor to drink, and the severe <unk> I would just pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera got too hot to it, and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run into the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> I don't know. Don't do it.
And it explained to me very clearly that to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not the citizenship of that country.
They could put them in a worse situation than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system for his release, and she trusted the way that they did.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to get my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids <unk> stones for miles through <unk> <unk> to trucks they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than children than the loaded and children put them on their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing with <unk>
When these villagers took their freedom, the <unk> had <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual trafficking, and because of this world consciousness advised me to be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously <unk>
It took me through a little bit stairs that gave this <unk> basement <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local for prostitution actors.
They have small rooms -- private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven -- they are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided up a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse in their hands of their customers.
From standing in the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that instant, I could barely imagine what it must be kept in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs and the stairs so on.
There was no <unk>
There was no windows and big enough for <unk>
Those people have no <unk> and because you touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, happens to us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that among 100,000 children and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex sex.
This is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families -- <unk> on the trade of silk.
This is a family.
The black hands of black are from the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me their stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
You still hope to get out of this house one day and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family on a boat, two old brothers, some more young children, a sense of sense, makes sense.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families -- <unk> <unk> and forced to work a lot of these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swim.
This boy is eight years old.
When our boat came up to came up to me -- I was going to find out that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of the water.
<unk> branches of trees submerged in Lake <unk> often catch networks and children, <unk> and fear, the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
As a fear of his love is not going to run off and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to be younger slaves under his charge.
I met these guys in the five o'clock in the morning, when we went through the last networks, but they had been working on the time.
It was on the cold night and <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in the <unk> the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi <unk> is possible.
Who will be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> out a road in Ghana with partners in <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his <unk> <unk> and <unk> our car and played the window.
It asked us to do it for a road of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were getting away from the car, and he asked the driver to go out very quickly.
Then you signal this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking about an hour we found out that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as I put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up to their backs and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> water.
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in your own sweat.
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have up to 90 feet and these people carry heavy plastic bags that then are shipped to another area where the stone would get the gold to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be full men and <unk> but if we look more close to the edge of the side, we see another less lucky and children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely to be able to end up as this victim of tuberculosis and the <unk> of mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took him to work with him in mines.
When he died his uncle, <unk> I took the debt of the uncle to be able to be a slave in mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis and yet, it's forced to work night and day on that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in the face of an remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on the <unk>
Did you know that your images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll be testimony to them and we'll do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves as human beings, then you do very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from other people, people -- real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect for their lives.
There's no day that I think I don't think about these so many beautiful people that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see, in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn into a fire and that fire fire on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do this applied mathematical math, and there's a particular problem for whom we are <unk> are like the management team.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were looking at the <unk> of the ballet <unk> and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later.
But drugs would be a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of skill and probably a certain initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease -- destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time was a virtuous <unk>
Over the last few years has been a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measure and an objective <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are not <unk> and so they don't serve the blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological test.
You have to go to a clinic to do this. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside the clinical trials, they never do. It's never done.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test they <unk>
It didn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to refer to you as a really conventional way to try, you can see, in a certain sense at least at least -- we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vibrating strings.
It shows someone healthy while it gives you a good while it gives you the sounds of an vocal ballet <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organ in order to produce sounds and we all have the genes -- it needs <unk> for example.
And as they did, it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think the time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal strings, as they <unk> and as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> also affects the organs.
In the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of irregular shake of vibrating strings.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do we compare these tests based on the voice with clinical clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use the existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a lot of cost that <unk> it appears at massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> difficulties of patients.
I don't have to go to the clinic for the <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get goals.
We could do a mass of low cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when you give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to tackle these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or Parkinson's disease, it can call under the price of a cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So we were doing all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, will be able to say who is healthy and who isn't it?
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not the disease. TR: Sure.
<unk> You can see, some people can not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of the confusion in search of the physical markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a precision <unk> at this point?
<unk> A lot more than that.
In fact, my graduate student -- I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well as the project. Now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> Of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of March of 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We were <unk> in the darkness, on the rooms with no windows and usually we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models -- even more <unk> the perfect skin -- even more <unk> we can be able to make it possible and we get into the press.
On March 11th of 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where it was <unk> there was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers -- we knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> people sitting in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by wave <unk>
The water level recorded over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
They have the rubble of the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools took the mud and we leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and they loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found some similar things.
They found pictures and pictures of pictures and cameras were <unk>
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of people around to <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of <unk> of the people.
It helped clean up the <unk> toilets, giant <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And there I had the honor that it took up and I had the honor that it was <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard of the expression of the <unk> but it was not until beyond my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some that had more than a hundred years -- some of them were still in the lab in the lab, I couldn't help but think about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I came up on Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl I had to do it with very much accuracy and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would have no aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the <unk> photo.
At the time of the time, they were lucky enough and they needed more <unk> so it came back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
In two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a town north of <unk>
Once on the week we use our scanner in the temporary computer libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their pictures.
And the time you get in <unk> it's a different story, dependent on of course the <unk> of the photos.
It could give you an hour. It could be <unk>
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw virtually as a guide the areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures that have taken in water -- covered in bacteria, with seaweed, even with oil with the time of the time -- I continue to get it through that <unk> by hand was a big part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless I was <unk> dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk> <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk>
As I said once he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought up these pictures was kind of a relationship to the photos.
He had started to <unk> her, but he stopped when they realize that they knew them even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and their own face was not supposed to be <unk> and we were able to put the images in a single picture, and we had a complete picture.
When I picked their pictures shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the photos in a fire station between the rubble very far from where their house used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their young children, not as small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find all his family and know that they all survived.
The day I gave him his pictures his younger son was 14.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that I could do -- something that I could remember from the past that would not have been tagged at the day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- hundreds of them were helped to clean up over <unk> photos -- the great <unk> -- most of them became the hands of their <unk>
Over 500 volunteers from all over the world helped us bring back to 90 families and hundreds of photos totally <unk> and <unk>
Over this time, we don't really spend more of <unk> in teams and materials, most of them in ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, someone loved.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would bring to look for.
This is the project to restore little pieces of humanity, to bring someone out of their connection with the past.
When a picture like this become somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a great difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger -- to bring something larger, using their talent to something that they don't be thin of perfect skin.
I would like to finish this email -- I emailed him Cindy that I came back from Japan after six months.
As I heard, I couldn't help but think about people and stories shown in the images.
A particular picture in particular, a picture of different ages from the grandmother to the little girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> because a similar picture of my family, my grandmother, my mother, my <unk> and my youngest daughter hangs from our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs is themselves, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on a sample of just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a trillion frames per second.
I give you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in a slow motion of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can be able to see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and <unk> really the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch it into a <unk> <unk> in a second or so, in a number of <unk> it will create a <unk> package of just one millimeter long.
And that package of photons, and that <unk> travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet of a bit.
If we take that bullet and this pile of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons spread inside this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in the <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel on the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola did not have this research.  <unk> many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with an photons package that starts <unk> and that, inside, you start <unk>
Part of the light gets <unk> goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside.
At that time, the waves travel down the table, and because of the top of the top of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, the insights will be <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current and we do that would go the same distance and we see it in slow to about 10 billion times, how much you think they would take us to sit on the movie?
One day? In fact, a week? It's actually a year.
It would be a very boring film, from a slow bullet in movement.
And what about testing <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato wall and the wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at once, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of events.
But if you look once more and more of this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light was <unk> of the tomato <unk> it's still bright.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and light bounces inside its inside and it goes back after several <unk> of second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera in MIT?
As a photographers, you know, if you take a <unk> <unk> it comes very little light into a <unk>
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition, so you just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded it and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> of data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk> in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow you to see it after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door -- <unk> into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light bulbs.
It's not science fiction. We already built.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons will come back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works this fast, our <unk> has unique capacities in it.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects -- but we don't know what dot is a distance.
When you project a laser -- you can record a photo in a few, which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try and analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the object.
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction of selection.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> <unk> with what it's going on on the curve.
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light reflected through light windows and open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the interior of the body through <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood is quite difficult, so actually, this is a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new model of visualizing to solve the problems in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, converted science into art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect every time is not just for scientific visualizations but we can get it.
To create a new form of computational photography with slow motion and <unk>
And look at those waves -- remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's a little bit of fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going away from us.
<unk> should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects -- Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which events happen in the world are sometimes invested in front of the camera.
<unk> the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can be <unk> life and gives you individual freedom.
With a cell phone can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, moving it to <unk> and make famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this town.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were going to go for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that they were gathering for a change, had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who is a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk>
It's a lot. We almost all have a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about me today about my mobile, and what changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission for the E.U. filed a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every single mobile company company, every single Internet vendor in all Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use your mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or your phone <unk>
And all over Europe and people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Germany in Eastern Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use the <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> that at the time I was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please get all the information that they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to it, and I got a concrete answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to get a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not giving this information.
At the end of the end, he agreed.
It would send me the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
At the beginning, I saw them, and I said, well, it's a huge file. Okay.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what I had to do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention means.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open Robert City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and go, go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to <unk> in the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
But of all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she called, talk a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call them each other.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big communication net.
You can see how your people communicate to each other to what time they call one another, which time they fall to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who send him an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall would never have happened.
And as a result, I also don't know the fall of <unk>
Because today's state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and they want to take them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come home to get home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and it's not very <unk>
When you go home, let's take your representative that only because companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that give them to remember they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hi intimate, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi intimate, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why we have all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. <unk>
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were siblings, siblings, even though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened to me at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they wish to be a disabled.
Let's go <unk>
<unk> <unk> are in the shopping center, driving in circles and what do you see?
16 empty empty places for a disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
And I mean, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There's a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I am a Muslim <unk> woman, disabled and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park Park in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in the starshade.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you be able to do it, <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters. I get a <unk>
If my three sisters went to public school, my parents would return to the school system, and it was <unk> that I was also outside, and if we didn't take all of the top note all of the top note, all of my mother.
My father taught me to walk in the age of five years putting up my feet and just walking.
Another tactical that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me to get it out.
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and and and ...
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion who has received a lot of speaking.
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arab and it's still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as opposed to campaign.
The people that grew up had no problem with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of starvation in terms of hunger during the <unk>
I would tell them that it was enough fat to live three months without eating three months without eating -- so you know, <unk> at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy -- so I was sent to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to go on the summer vacation on the coast of treating I wasn't coming.
I spent my summers into a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we don't go back to Palestine all of the <unk> we were going to become <unk>
In summer vacation -- I often tried to <unk> so I was drinking milk milk in my back, and I was getting cups hot on my back, and I was <unk> in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before you do yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents had this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college with positive discrimination and I got a grant for the University of Arizona, because I was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> in the theater department.
All of me <unk>
I did all the less smart, I took the ultimate note in my own, and also in their classes.
Every time I made a scene from the glass zoo my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> "The End will have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
In order to <unk> In order to <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask her why and she told me that because they believed that I couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role for that that literally had been born and they gave it to an actress without cerebral <unk>
The college was causing my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors with no disabled tribe.
When I went <unk> I came home, and my first tour, <unk> was like an extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> friend of <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I was there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than <unk> and it was clear to me that the directors of <unk> don't <unk> actors, with disability.
Just give you perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
In my first tour, tour, famous <unk> New York City to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he was at the top of New Jersey on the highway of New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little nasty rumor that says that women are not fun, and they are very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media, and when I remind you to the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by wire has Keith <unk>
I came up as if I went to a graduate dance, I went to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I beat up the speaker desk so that I couldn't get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
By the end, I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew I'd never come to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I got a little bit of my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me or a little bit of a little old.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became a <unk> object.
<unk> music clips like, "Why <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist <unk>
What disease does it have?
We should actually pray for it.
A piece suggested even I would say, my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't do that <unk> then <unk> you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the -- yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that I don't know -- but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with the media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the so-called <unk> <unk>
I came to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world -- "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> children a charity to give the Palestinian refugee children, a little bit of what my parents would give me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in live, and I focus this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know your name, but I know your story.
She lives in a little town to the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> to the small village to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there's no opportunity, no job, no work <unk>
He has just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day you have a gentleman who offered it to <unk> after for dinner, to <unk>
It meets a dynamic group of people, which gives him a break.
She gets a little bit of money for you to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
They present a young boy.
Finally, they go home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A very beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That little child of that little village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist bomber and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a connected organization to the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a small town a little town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start your future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that he took away from what we call "the period of <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban young urban <unk> <unk> <unk> in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, jobs, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest crime rates.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of access to terror, to violence, to <unk> to be the history of 2.0 cities.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember going to be in front of that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be at that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to return to a few youth leaders at a business coral.
<unk> about 90 juvenile leaders, <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain rain on solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
I had no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, which was a graduate college college college was the perfect white white for Al <unk> and other terrorist organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point A to the B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a company of <unk>
They started <unk> motorbikes to local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the corporate spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking so <unk>
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the height of corporate initiative and how to make a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years old, and until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers to your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from the abroad.
If you ask somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those of you who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company of <unk> and design <unk>
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And the delivery of flowers for weddings -- creating gardens in the homes, and the cities of the city, and now it's working on creating the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
You want to create a space where young families, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So to inspire young people and create a culture of corporate spirit is really a big step, but young people need a capital to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation for <unk> in the development and put it on their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources that need to be able to get the support that need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the corporate spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His <unk> is how it called, when it is created, transforming the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent to rent and keep the bikes for him.
It gave them the opportunity to escape from the paralysis of the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their frugal innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks Parks that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest.
The sun was made that the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it won't be the way that we can <unk> almost we could pretend we were the first human beings to step back in that ground.
We came to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with an hearts of apple -- <unk> balls of aluminum paper and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and <unk>
The <unk> that they were too lazy to get out what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
So that question followed by me, and you get a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where it is, <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, which is the reason for 11 thousand tons of waste and two thousand tons of products -- every day.
I wanted to know that as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and get that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked out of his routes and interviewed people in office and interviewed people in the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more <unk>
So I started working as <unk> of trash.
Now I didn't just just travel in the trucks. I am <unk>
And operated the mechanical and <unk> and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as high as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong you are rapidly <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of getting on their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Labor <unk> the collection of waste is one of the <unk> <unk> of the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all day and pass <unk> around you.
They just want <unk> so usually the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also, the garbage itself is full of dangers that they often fall in the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about the relentless of garbage.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
You never stop coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It must always be moving.
And the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that the <unk> are the most important hand hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in a very efficient and effective way every day, this starts to get rid of their container and their dangers are either threaten in very real ways.
Since we had controlled for decades, and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have space for what the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered percent.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just put his relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
I mean, just at the speed of the time we used to move in the contemporary time.
We usually don't have any <unk> and we cleaned up with us our coffee cup -- our bag of the <unk> our water bottle.
We use them -- we <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that would take away from it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the harvest of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and we will engage in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keep us safely away from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow has always been in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a pack of waste <unk> on the street, grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be right."
And shortly after that, I started looking at the collection of waste and I went back to the man.
It's called <unk> we work together, and we did good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we exist on this planet as we have to include and have to account all the costs -- even the very real human cost of labor.
<unk> waste, what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is cleaning up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life forming a part of the environment where architecture is naturally born of the conditions and local traditions.
Today, I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us like example, to my team and to me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After looking at some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's a weather where it's about 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And third, it looks nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a worth of being as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, he was actually actually enchanted with the old market that is this structure in the air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of various stories, by applying these principles.
So the next challenge was introduced to <unk> the website, which is located in a much area of a lot of the city growth zone, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, not yet.
And it's also between two parallel streets that they don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the entries in the building.
And this goes with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space to the open air in the building that would spread through their own shape of the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes on every floor because of the way of space.
I also thought, how close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric to a concrete shell.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons on the dresses of <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little crystals of colors that use the light inside the building to light the building at night.
So with these ideas that was not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center, it wasn't what I <unk>
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the commercial center because they had more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade was a lot more economic -- not only because of the material with the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings on the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, and they collect water in the inside.
It's waiting for the early year of next year, because we're going through the fifth building floor.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the bigger that I have designed, so I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> a structure of a thousand years old, which was surrounded by a <unk> with twelve doors of access to almost straight.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was extend the streets existing and creating 12 early blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of doors and straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
And so we would take a scheme to make sure that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to them.
And it also responds to local norms that they set up a higher density at higher levels and a lower density in the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community and occupied space by building construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go up and forth and do activities such as a <unk> race race in the morning, or jump out of an building to another building.
These two examples, have a common focus on the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes the communities and local economies at the same rate that the buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment and they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had very bright amounts of hair, and a little <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year, and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I was a time after the high school was a little late and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was concerned, salt, I entered the classroom, I took from my teacher to the grades.
And then I did.
<unk> the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just some these.
And I set up to the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes all over the world, without any imagination.
I put them all rows of <unk> and myself a row of that, just because of being there, because I am."
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never came back.
It's all obvious <unk>
I never came up with me.
But most of all, I was telling me, the reason I really bother me that this little little girl, was so good for <unk>
Do jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
<unk> birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of jobs in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that would take the loneliness, or the long duration or sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab in which you study the <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if I didn't have jealousy, <unk> there would be not literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> lists of high school lists -- because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and we were <unk> from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there is no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as much as adults almost have all of them.
This year has been 100 years of their <unk> <unk> <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also of the ordinary <unk> my whole thing that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of it, right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how hard that image.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were so hard as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy, that jealousy, that are reduced to the person, their desire, their <unk> are a good basis of narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details to do to <unk> the knife, right?
<unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that is something that I had to understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could be pleasure to another, maybe same."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh charm that <unk> detects in his restaurant, it adds it to his collection of instruments of torture in their private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great amounts of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> came up with the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well language language with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his hotel agony of soon listening to the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in your <unk> they're search for knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to need -- that makes us suffer, it causes us to make a range of much more profound and vital feelings that a wise man can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for <unk> women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> are disclose to ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There's some other excitement to us our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other excitement that teaches us to look at that <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very young man who was consuming with the idea that his wife <unk>
And Freud said that there was something strange in that man, who didn't be <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or do not accidentally accidentally win with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> are going to take us to look at intensity but no accuracy.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we are more in residents of fantasy.
And because of this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts on us.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman of Michigan from 52 years of age was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from which they were sending horrible messages to themselves, for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend, and I have to say that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How large, even though we make creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character from the American literature.
It's the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books trying to deal with our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> at a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to know about your way and to <unk> from what you might ever get to, and it's under the floor -- <unk> your <unk> it takes your rings, cow bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you the rest of the world, both as long as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in the time of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not secure, when they are to a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the head face of <unk> <unk> <unk> which needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers it.
Oh, I sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of those puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once he <unk> <unk> to all with his solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to shake your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> transferred in history. It seems to me very emotional -- that scene is really mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
So at the next minute they're the same side.
<unk> <unk> it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
Could it still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to <unk>
Well, maybe we don't have to get it from the excellence of the other.
We can engage with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction <unk>
It's just true <unk> jealousy.
The fiction used <unk> invites them to the table.
And look what <unk> <unk> <unk> the scary thing Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in a great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside of the Apollo mayor of Apollo 11 and went on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the gray surface of the <unk> was the culmination of a collective process of <unk>
The Apollo program was the largest decline in the U.S. history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget today.
Apollo gave a couple of 400,000 people and asked <unk> million companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including <unk> crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which was the <unk> of <unk> the past year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some of you ask, why do you say?
Why turn it into our goal?
And they might also ask, why can we scale the top <unk>
35 years ago, why would fly over <unk>
Why does Rice play against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> <unk> for the <unk> was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> to the amount of powers of technology.
They were because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a sailing ship -- but in 1969, the Apollo crew flew to 40,000 miles / hour.
From 1970, no human being has become the moon.
No one traveled faster than the Apollo crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> by looking at the problems that we imagine that technology would be going to be able to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I was going to see colonies on Mars.
So that thing happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have come up with us and they had enriched toys with trivial, things like <unk> apps and social media, or algorithms that speed up with sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't know the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is an inclusive explanation in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years in which we <unk> Intel Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> in concrete, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of <unk> ideas for the funding of <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mainly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk venture capitalists were at their top point without worrying about risk, they preferred small investments that could be out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been problems to invest with the benefit in technologies as energy, that they need a huge capital and that development is also not invested in the development of technologies dedicated to solving big problems because they don't have a commercial value right away.
No, the reason we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and <unk>
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But go to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everybody thinks there are things more important than doing on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from sources like solar and wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic
Water and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties <unk> the development of a <unk> energy <unk> a significant increase in research and development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we'll see an energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed <unk> are not going to be.
We know from a long time that famines are result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for the storage and food route, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nixon president was declared war to cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant cancer -- and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need -- but these four elements have to be <unk> Chinese leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support <unk> should be really about a <unk> problem, and we must understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it turns out to make those positions.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and dangerous, and there's not a popular mythology of fiction -- like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we're not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a great decrease of trust, it's a very general belief in it.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think that <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, what people think about trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It makes me bow to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions and that could be augmented in others.
I don't have it.
But I can turn to opinion surveys and opinion polls are supposedly the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at government polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> about 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they are still quite a little bit of <unk> included nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half of the way.
But that's what enough?
What the record polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people seem to be given when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I would probably tell you to ask, "What do you do?
And that would be a very famous answer.
And you could say, when you said to your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other not."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to make trust in a <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official, and a guy in a person is going to be a uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I trust a certain teacher of elementary school I know to give the class of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we let all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they're trying to get the good judgment to the fact that you trust something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I would argue, to have more confidence in which it's <unk> but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who were getting their savings very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the raw commodities and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But yes, in the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that I would have a <unk> of your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is we are going to look at before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so forth, that they made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> that I will go into <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives, and we would find that the system of accountability which is destined to ensure the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
And you probably know all of you know similar examples.
<unk> all of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were trying to be worthy of trust, and we will give people to people who are reliable and if you try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the judgment, the simple actions, -- the <unk> which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they are two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately is defined because they give us the other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the same foundations for them to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, it's because you can't afford to <unk> all the time, all the time.
But you also have to be able to deliver <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That goes on every day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks -- says I can <unk> it without giving explanations anymore.
I wear them and get my money back, or they change it through the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not very hard to <unk>
What people trust is in the relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how other people are worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the glass of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have any <unk>
I started to imagine how to do it.
First of all, I created this tool that gets deeper into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers your physical body to the West.
The designers can lead their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, you break the barriers.
But the two hands remain out of the screen.
How can we get inside and interact with the digital information using the whole person's ability.
In the Computer <unk> division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and turned a little space on the keyboard on a digital area of work.
<unk> a sleeping bombsight with deep cameras to detect your fingers and the face, now you can raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and files have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down on every single single screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest papers and we make digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us would have bought and start things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
So if we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make them be physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would it be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical sphere.
This magnet magnet behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this tiny three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> the gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And by digitally digitally mimicking the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and come back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and physically and the famous <unk> of Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality that we want to.
The students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of the planets, the physics, and unlike the monitors or the textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without that we have to be aware of our world.
So we started talking today about a barrier, but if you will, that barrier, the only limit that lies is our imagination.
Thank you.
I stood up to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for all expenses payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed strongly that there was only a proper path to <unk> a safe and good job.
No matter whether or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera singer, but my dream.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I got to write to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult asked the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream will never be <unk>
<unk> that during the rest of my life a second class happiness is the only thing that I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look at another <unk>
No one in my way I wanted to be <unk> OK.
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> I came to America in 1995, and what were the first books I read here?
Those were <unk> in China, of course.
<unk> <unk> It's about Chinese <unk>
And it is not a permanent <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but they strange.
That's a subject to another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave up to my habit of reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map it seemed to me because this is what students in China learn it.
I had never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if reading comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual costs.
To the Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and duty to <unk> interesting.
If you know other language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path from <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> path, the way of the <unk> Alan <unk> rather than lost in translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and present.
I know I won't feel like I used to feel or powerless ever.
Having a <unk> dream really is nothing compared to what many others have been <unk>
I've come to believe that this is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams, of where the passion, of where happiness.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in Berkeley in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> dropped on the couch in my office and grabbed the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My friend of class had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I got a <unk> who wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex led to the <unk> it made me very easy to just move the head while to <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and so I saw she was right.
You start to work after, you get children later, and then the death goes on.
For sure, as Alex and I had time to go.
But a little bit later, my <unk> <unk> was pushed me to tell Alex to talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Yeah, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not as if I was to marry him."
And then my scandal said, "No, no, but maybe you get married with the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were doing, but this didn't have the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in his development.
This made the folks from Alex were the perfect moment, and we were <unk>
And so I realized, this kind of embarrassed. benign problem was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think nobody comes to age without going through the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yes. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream of a <unk> I want to see. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that they give you a way to your life will have happened to be 30 and <unk>
<unk> people from over 40, did not be <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half Americans are married, they live or they are coming out with their future couple to 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and it will be <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change themselves, now is now the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that the female fertility comes to its top to 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time for <unk> over your body and your options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and the attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which his daily life and common life has an impact on the person who gets <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call <unk> an extended adolescence.
The journalists were <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to get great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think when you give a <unk> in your head and you say, "you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't look absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, <unk> really interesting <unk> like you or your children and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't know -- I'm just killing a time."
Or they say, "All people say that while I start a race before the 30, it's all right."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
He had better resume the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game play.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, he turned the music and everybody started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be going to stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure on 30 and so many of you start a career, choose a city, to choose a partner, and have two children or three children in a much longer time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying up red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the race you want now.
<unk> you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but I couldn't still decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living in a very difficult time, his previous life had been even more difficult.
They are often going on in our <unk> but then she stood up to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma came his head on his legs and <unk> for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent all the morning I had a lot of <unk> but then you got to see the empty space that follows after the <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk>
I was about <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if you give me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of resist job, and I didn't say, <unk>
The thing that Emma needed was not a <unk> which is actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit as the <unk> <unk> went forward.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> men or woman, deserves to know.
First, I told Emma that <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> capital of identity.
For capital capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: capital of identity generates identity capital.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that they want to try to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration <unk> I'm <unk> the exploration that I should not have to count, that, by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and to make it count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with minds that are similar to who you know what you think about how you talk about, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out of almost always comes out of the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak bonds friends of their friends.
Yes, half of them have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half not, and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
The half of the jobs that we have never had to get off, then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job in a <unk>
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as he was growing up, Emma soon would return to his family, when he has a partner and a role in his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
You might think that 30 percent is better enough to sit in mind than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now or let you be <unk> now when all on Facebook start walking towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before we have, and that means to be as <unk> in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it is going to work or kill a time with anyone who will be <unk> to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the fellow <unk> in a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That job offer gave a reason to leave the boyfriend, with the living one.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, love his new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the space of emergency contacts are not good enough.
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like airplanes that come from the Los Angeles, from Los Angeles, who come to some place in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in their trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the 21st or the age of 25 or even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I have the privilege of telling <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get a capital capital -- you get their weak ties.
Don't define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to <unk> mathematics to <unk> <unk> in New York City in New York.
And like any teacher, I test tests and tests.
Let me give you tasks.
When I work back, I will take grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of them who had a better performance didn't have scores <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that made me think.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After many years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a sort of psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you're successful in school and life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and in every study, my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We are trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National National <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers <unk> working on very difficult neighborhoods <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private companies, what about these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts. It came up with a feature like an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have resistance.
The determination is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a career at all.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students that did my questionnaires and then waited about over a year to see who was <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly better than <unk> even when the <unk> in every single aspect that I could measure, things like family income, the results of evidence -- even the safety of the evidence that children felt when they were in school.
So it's not only at the West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where it matters <unk> is also in school, especially for the children at risk of <unk>
To me, the most powerful thing about determination is the little thing that we know about the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you development for children?
What do I have to do to teach kids a solid <unk> <unk>
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly determination is not related or is even related to the measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about develop determination in children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when you get older, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mentality of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother and beauty, and the shape of Chinese characters are.
From that moment, I was inspired by this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall <unk>
Over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new way and quickly learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
An Chinese academic will be <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy to understand.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signals from traffic <unk> menus to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as it might be <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the way of fire is a person with arms on both sides as if I were screaming very <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it's the other way that it works.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of an <unk> in the old West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
These are building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, three are a crowd.
If a person stretches your arms, this person is saying, <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a speaker tree is pretty idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two sides together, it gets very hot.
Three <unk> -- that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
And you take a door. Put a board inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is getting hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together are <unk>
Three women together, are <unk>
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters are building other 32.
So with each little effort, you're going to be able to learn a couple hundred of characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese for eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
And we know that Japan is the Earth <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun alongside the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
An Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become out.
A mouth that tells you where you're going to go out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four, and we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film was <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
And he gave a magic excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic wand to it.
But when you see that film, so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a kind of a <unk> industrial sports show.
And yet, the magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took for a half 40 years later with, interestingly, the other film whose <unk> a metal boy and a kid <unk> <unk> a girl dresses as a <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a great difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the films that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician, you do today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz like the prophecy.
<unk> <unk> shoes to defeat the <unk> produced by the computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the only one of the magician, is that the most popular characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I asked Star Wars a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son.
Only three years.
He was not invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had been <unk>  And so he was in the room in the room and he was impressed as a mom left with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be topics of value, <unk> and <unk>
I should have the sense that Luke is one of an army to overthrowing the government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do you win his movie?
And by doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to grow up, right?  And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much underground force in the movies for our children, and so little the way of <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of the movies of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how children react to this encouragement.
I know the experience that the princess <unk> does not give me the proper framework that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first grade, I was really hoping that users started to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search is done, I have a girlfriend.
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
<unk> are focused on <unk> to <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave any time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the Disney <unk> for any of you.
But they send a message to children, even though they, guys, are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job when you teach girls how to defend them, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend from the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, so <unk> and <unk> as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all time continues to get up in classic <unk> every one of them about the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, he finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came back.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is the proof of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It still has no roots and they are already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book comic and in the middle of the '80s, I recorded a conversation that I had with a friend of the films that you saw.
And it's very simple. There's only three questions that should be <unk> in the movie, there are more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than the kid you like it?  <unk> Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality movie.
Right? <unk> from <unk> success -- an idea of consensus that is a movie of Hollywood <unk>
<unk> doesn't happen the proof of <unk>
And I don't think it's a lot about the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, in the most popular movies, how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not wrong.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there is a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times ran a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, "This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with it.
Nor do I believe that music videos or pornography are closely wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a great amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you not achieve <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We're <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter as those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this statistic very alarming statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> <unk> <unk> goes to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite favorite character of "Star <unk> Do you know what they said?
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories in which you tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where it looked like his work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I was most like was looking for sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand -- and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was fascinated by <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the archeology.
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of nearly 1,300 miles of length along with a <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a located sitting in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place in simple sight, seems to be brown but when we use infrared and we process it using fake, suddenly the place looks like bright pink as well.
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by the building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptians of the same.
I want to share with you how the satellite data is used to find an old city, a very old city, called <unk> missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place stands in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located at some place near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, it moved to this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find that random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So, we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where we get the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area is slightly high that you see inside the circle here, that we think it could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists doing <unk> jobs you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the sample of it on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation for us.
Five meters down, under a thick <unk> layer -- we found a dense <unk> of toxic objects.
This means that in this possible location location -- five feet down, we have a layer of occupation from several hundred years to date from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle East, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry shop which shows that what has been there, it was a very important city.
We still don't find any <unk> here, but we went to the place in a near future for <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also do great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire the Middle Empire was probably written in <unk> four years ago:
The knowledge is the highest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So according to TED, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas happen really started in 1984 <unk> C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from high school.
It certainly puts the <unk> <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside the door to <unk> home.
I'd like to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that you're made.
Now <unk> a group of obese <unk> in bicycles.
They're competing in a <unk> race and go back to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide in front of the door of their house.
There are bikes flying everywhere, wheels that pass on on their side of the wheels that end up in <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door, <unk>
When you get to the lobby, the hall, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
He's waving with your hand.
From their chair, on a brown horse on a brown horse <unk>
It's a horse that talks about.
You can feel your blue <unk> in your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you can go to a little bit of <unk> in the mouth.
They went on a side and they trained their living room.
In the room, and making most of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing about his <unk> <unk> singing <unk> One more <unk>
Now let's go to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow brick path and the oven come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that takes every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, waiting, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages ladies and different kinds of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, just look at them once.
<unk> the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
I ate whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who I could memorize very quickly the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be the phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England, and he has one of the better memories.
And I asked her, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have an average memory actually.
All of those who participate in this competition say that they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using these ancient techniques invented two and a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that the medieval academics used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside of the competition of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and bright English English thing, although a little bit <unk> said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live in national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
And I ended up spending most of the year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what your potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that would allow you to see how to point out and what our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> <unk> In he based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went a afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on the back, I read a number of treaties on the memory written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it wasn't a thing as rare as you might look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but it also has changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would argue that they have changed a cognitive basis.
As we have almost no longer need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this incredibly unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there is <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College invited a group of memory, in the lab.
They wanted to know: To be able to have brains in some structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than <unk>
They gave them a battery of cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, you know, <unk> their brains and <unk> faces and shapes of snow -- they found that in the memory markets, they found out in the <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They were actually <unk> or seemed to be <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for competitive <unk> is driven as a armed race in which every year, someone has a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors must have a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times <unk>
On his desk in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these parties, absolutely all techniques that are used by the end of the end of that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the following: I say to two people who remember the same word.
That's your <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there is a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them, <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which is <unk>
The person who was told that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that your job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, really does mean nothing for you. There's no relationship to you.
And with all the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They spend good when they come back home from work.
Would you probably get some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back and a half thousand years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is like this: There was a poet named <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring a <unk> to <unk> a <unk>
He stood up to me, <unk> his poem by memory, and it was <unk> and it was as soon as the <unk> was <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting there.
So they wouldn't be able to get the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
I stopped standing outside, he only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single time.
I took the family of <unk> <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What you see, you noticed at that moment is something that we all know most or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good at remembering or phone numbers or the word for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you asked them to tell me, the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to say who was sitting on the <unk> horse in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember -- the crazy <unk> -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> be the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory memory in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do that, in the same way that it would have done <unk> if they invited it to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, <unk> crazy image to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on the <unk> <unk>
And that would remember you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then I would play in the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a year, and they have some friends to help him remember it.
This is like <unk> <unk> <unk> their speeches -- not word for word, which is going to confuse them but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek, which means <unk>
It's a fan of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first would be like the first place in his palazzo of memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with it.
I went to some of these memory meetings and I had the idea of writing a huge thing about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
But seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone comes to the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was fun.
I would never have expected it to be <unk>
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually about doing is better to improve the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was hooked pretty much with this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of safety glasses -- covered with tape only two <unk> because the rain is the worst enemy of a <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered in a year before, and I had the idea that it could be <unk> in a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve a good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone numbers, and it's actually not the point.
These are just <unk> tricks.
Because they're based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insights on how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a big memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> really.
They work because they do <unk>
You know, <unk> a kind of deep processing -- a kind of attention that most of you are not going to hang on there.
But the reality is there is no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today is what <unk> <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what's already our <unk> <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is walking on our side -- we will be so <unk> that we wouldn't even be able to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capacities for all of us.
But if you want to live a life -- you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It is a complex issue, so we would have just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> love I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' house in a village called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was an balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time when I was watching television. And so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, all of you, and every time I got married, and I would get involved in a towel -- all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and I hated it.
And I took that journey, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, nor about division of areas, but of those connections to emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's no wonder that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency go 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want to think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it by based on a building built two and a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time ago.
We use it 200 years ago to build <unk>
We used it in the 19th century to build a museum of art.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments, always are afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that you know they're going to work.
So we found them with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library and the <unk> which was in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> it has this round thing, columns, brick red, which are going to communicate with this <unk> the children, the value values the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, had a library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new technologies, new solutions for life forms today.
We were going to try and put it so much, that we get out of the people.
All of the black, this is us -- you think we feel very well, but we're dead in because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and come back with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we started to experience <unk> so we start to swing the <unk> <unk> over and over again, so we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I was about the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Something really really hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
<unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that I like and the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add the bake and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't take <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial centers, we moved to the slums, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
These fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian <unk>
Maybe with a fish sticks with bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> now we have new <unk> design techniques -- and we found it with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally, the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world to architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical academic and public <unk> were completely seen by a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> construction.
The tourism in Bilbao grew up in a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everyone wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first architect star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous across the world?
And it happened, because the media will spread around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created a emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing did the main mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new government happened with other star architects.
It went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to happen with all of the architecture. The digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think for example, how do you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked up to the next people to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers in architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast, the architecture.
It doesn't have a lot of time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I knew if the one who designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen. Because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> and the <unk> and the media revolution.
My theory is that when the pendulum applies to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until you get in both of the extreme extremes of <unk> and you can effectively get the difference between innovation and a symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the public.
We can now make symbols of <unk> <unk> of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works, in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked like the product -- there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to get and they share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, and it became a means of communication, because these are not just images of a building, this is the images that you did from the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that does <unk> with collective memory, and by bringing these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building is built today, first of all, <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
They were bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there is no single response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and pink drawings and one is no longer a <unk> public that doesn't embrace something that I hadn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't get <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in tomorrow will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical brick in ideas of what a stadium.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, also it can serve for sport or to <unk> or even you can get married at night.
This means that three architects can dream about swimming in the East <unk> in New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the community united around that cause, it's no customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make more intelligent buildings, smarter and more kind.
We've been expecting all of you to want them.
Finally, we're not on opposite place.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings doesn't only reflect our society, but they give it to the most <unk> spaces, local libraries where local libraries are we formed our children, and the step of the room to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it makes it very cool for the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that the most likes to do for the moment is to look at it in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives itself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And he turns out all his friends are doing this and my mom tells me that I used to do this. And when I had to think about doing this?
How do you suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at <unk> "I am <unk>
This is <unk> she's 13 years old, and it lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone says it is ugly.
What her mom says and what his friends, or fellow colleagues say, "You don't know who to believe.
So a video of her itself, publishes it on YouTube, and begs others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or a <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and healthy teenager who gets these answers in one of the stages of their more vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking to you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way in a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures on the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, to be always connected -- is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no division between a online life and the real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what's rigged digitally.
What is the most important thing in the life of someone in front of someone in front of a single context in a day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And that trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see with what young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
It's like the <unk> stars, and the singers to <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals right now.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we are teaching our children to spend more time and make mental effort to their look, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities -- their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six of the 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for growth as human beings and as human beings to society and the business development camp.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom. They would be involved in the classroom arguments because they don't want to call attention by their physical form.
One of five are not attending classes at all day during the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of exams, if you don't think you look at it good enough, it specifically if you don't think you're smart enough -- <unk> a single note to the average of your fellow who don't care about that looks.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, the United States and China, in the U.S.
And it turns out regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So, in order to be good of course, we're talking about as you see you, not what you're really like.
The low self-esteem of his body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing fewer physical activity, eating less fruits and vegetables, fewer fruits and vegetables, they are not healthy that they can bring them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around and are in higher risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this because of what they make more decisions -- like the consumption of alcohol and of drugs, diet <unk> aesthetics, sexual relationships to ages early and no protection and harm.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?"
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes -- the first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing that, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are going to not only have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These are six aspects of the crucial starting points for anyone willing to provide an education in your body to work.
One education is a difference, but dealing with this problem requires each of us to take the reins on the issue and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
Consider the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not a good thing to do with the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to start to judge people for what they are, not as you see.
We can all begin by taking the responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you when it was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow to rape all of their person to be valuing the individuality, of diversity, <unk>
We need to put people in which it's actually making the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make it be they come out on the big screen because only we will create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you see that they are never known to be who they are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your life.
Who do you have in mind?
A <unk>
A <unk>
A <unk>
A <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two feet away, what it would mean for her if I was liberated from that <unk> voice in his interior, which was <unk> by not having a long legs. <unk> more <unk> a <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we did this, and we would call his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk> all of us.
But let's go to our children the truth.
And you know, the way you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because of how they make us feel.
We went to self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, will become practical agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
The five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
By <unk> initially they would honor him, but being prisoner for other <unk> charges in others, started planning attacks at about 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations <unk>
Fortunately, those plans was <unk> by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be <unk>
Later, I would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a <unk> American <unk> teacher from primary elementary school among the two made every possible <unk>
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims come to meet.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to want to want the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all human group, there is always a little fraction of people who were getting so <unk> to their convictions that think we need to use all the possible means for everyone to live as them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat with me and explained that in the last week of week, he and a few friends, had been going to fight training in Long Island, to practice.
He said I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> of <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my father <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder, and explained how to point the goal to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet he shot gave him to the little light on the goal and for surprise of all, especially of me, all the goal broke into fire.
My uncle came back to the rest and Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, it was such a son.
And all of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they thought that they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of putting a van <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, and causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times, that instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone was a time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class that they often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret -- my identity to avoid being the white, but to be the new of the quiet class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent my house reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to put it so <unk> <unk> <unk> was not prepared for the real world.
So I was <unk> opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like your race or your religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way of thinking was during the presidential election in 2000.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found out that one of the kids who had done to survive, was Jewish people.
I took several days to go out to the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having been able to beat the barrier that all of life had been made me believe that he was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush -- a park of <unk>
I met people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience became fundamental in the development of my character.
All of life had been taught that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay men were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay players there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the smallest and less critical that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I would have to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how it is that it will be <unk> but I know what it is to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest with my <unk> and help me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, don't have anything to do with character.
In many ways, he became my shape <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not a avail.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something that conserving my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the <unk> eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside of your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else who is trying to bring to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, than even though I was reminded of this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, and for their loved pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking, to talk about those <unk> acts like rejection of my father's actions.
With this one, I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race. That kids don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my dad.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this point there is a film that is projected in your minds.
It's an incredible movie movie.
It's in 3D, and it has sound <unk> of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> flavor and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger will pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood moments that project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your own conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in play.
This film is your <unk> the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie -- your own, you and you.
There's nothing to get more directly.
At least I know I have an <unk>
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we weren't aware of, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we just not just robots, which we have to produce to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, it's objective of objective about.
<unk> for nature, it's <unk>
So you can never have a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, I think that vision.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior, and the neuroscience is studying the brain -- but nobody has ever mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there was very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> as Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flourishing of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problem with consciousness.
It doesn't address the real core mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an inner inner movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, and how are the <unk> how they behave and adapt and <unk> the living organisms -- all of them are questions about how you work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, and how we talk about, how we play <unk> all of these are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question of why all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still don't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to take care of this point.
We have a big cool chain of explanations. We were accustomed to this, the physics explains chemistry, explains chemistry, explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we're aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know still how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need to need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning are <unk> crazy before we could deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Her crazy idea is that there is no difficult problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of our brain behaviors -- the behaviors of the brain, and this is what everything needs to be explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of nature purely <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to it.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time you get there, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as the core <unk> space and the mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic.
On the contrary, they look more fundamental -- and the world is being built.
Sometimes the very fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, time, mass law, and then I applied the basic laws of the <unk> and it applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those <unk> laws.
I think that's the situation we found with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, you know, space, time, dough, <unk> -- then for the matter of logic, you have to get a <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that it's suddenly not a real object.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws of consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other core concepts -- the space, the time, the mass, the physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious -- not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the <unk> even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when you think my "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some sense of crude feeling -- it will give some sense of crude sense of consciousness.
This can sound a little crazy for you.
How would anyone think something so <unk>
Some of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that <unk> thinking about thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there are information processing, there are consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> complex as a human consciousness in a human awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple information.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And I'm supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse is a half of information integration of information, just as much as important awareness of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is lower, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different awareness level of scratch.
<unk> a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers are often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies the bottom.
How explains Stephen Hawking, where does the fire come from?
From view, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts it into the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there in the center.
This vision is, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to address our relationship with nature, and it can have social consequences and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that was supposed to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think that by doing well, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing, so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
So if this is right, they have very serious ethical problems about the ethics of the development of smart computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the collective consciousness -- the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group -- as the audience at a TED Talk, and now we have a TED collective consciousness for this full set of TED, different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least one question you must take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually most confident of the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second is that it's universal.
So vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve that overnight.
But I think we finally will be able to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal, one under an educational profile.
I went to school, I went back to my friends, my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to get it for a prize for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's an obvious problem.
She's actually not <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After the school, I had a under the profile of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, yes. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, when I was in the second part of teaching in a high school of <unk> just after about 20 minutes in the middle of <unk> <unk> a guy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when will you go to your <unk>
And I said, "What is <unk>
Well, I had been talking to you about the law of <unk> for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs of wheels, they talk about things going on to school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this kid had had experiences with people who have disabilities like inspiration.
And we don't, and it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people who are disability are not our masters or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to you about disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A <unk>
It's a bad thing and live with a disability makes you <unk>
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl with no hands drawing with a pen held through the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with a carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the porn term <unk> because we get to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we had to engage the disabled disabled people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the count of the number of times that I've been approached by strange <unk> to express that you believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my job had a public profile.
It was as though I was getting away in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, these images are linked to people who are disability to people with no disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't that bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
They have some things.
But the things that we spread aren't the things that you might think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was interested in the so-called social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the commons.
They are simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to do it in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lying, because they've sold us this lie that disability makes us really cool.
And honestly it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to load the battery out of the mobile phone on the car battery.
Great.
We learn from the force and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that would be <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that has been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability, in life is a bad <unk> the reason that it's lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a stretch of stairs has not made it become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen will not appear the subtitles for the <unk> people.
Nor do a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> isn't considered to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people who are disability to be <unk> to wake up from bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child of 11 in a school school in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think is what you think about it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the augmented reality and the professional football with <unk>
And what is the average velocity of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so you know, please don't be <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So, how do we get to the reality of <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what's going to be a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to get <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will <unk> with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, Glass, be under a helmet and know what is running through the game camp, and the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man of 110 pounds of <unk> trying to do it with all of his self.
I've been there and I assure you it's nothing nice.
So I got some videos to show you what the Google would use under the helmet, and give them a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of the <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of emerging technology is a submarine coming up to the surface.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment -- a little bit <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, being your favorite players and asked me on YouTube and asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, look at us how we get it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which many of you know it.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh my God, Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a movie from Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What's the experience of a fan of a fan.
When I could be <unk> running through the <unk> releasing the ball back into the network? I heard a <unk> in <unk>
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve the fact that <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality -- augmented reality when <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a brief refresher on the <unk> technology.
In 1965, the <unk> <unk> put a <unk> to his field of field to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl, that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, more fast.
In 1994, the <unk> placed radii in the <unk> of the field of field and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was more fast, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to your group and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate to lose games.
If you lose games like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a playbook <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium, having a view from the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys are <unk> of information.
So this is <unk> to the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being for themselves.
It's also to be <unk> Who would have been <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's the field <unk>
You get the ball and <unk>
<unk> a <unk> receptor on the left of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- that a defense behind you is going to <unk> we don't know it, but the <unk> system will be <unk>
<unk> the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open receptor.
<unk> the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land -- yet, the receptor sees in your bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can change the career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed it from each angle.
This is something that creates a massive excitement in the game.
So I'm going to do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the ground.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask them is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> as our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much does this technology is worth a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth doing for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live as <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> or one Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets closer.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I was recently raised after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years -- the country <unk> the southern tip of <unk> County -- which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known as the <unk> of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who had to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much at proof of <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers are going to bring it to another dimension, so that the fall of it frees you out of all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that are going on under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one each.
The impact break into bones, some of which are <unk> vital organs.
Most of them dies of impact.
The ones that don't normally fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that <unk> this unit of suicide is realizing the <unk> death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people have been before they had to get their life.
I can tell you to experience that once the person is on that edge, and in its dark moment, it's very difficult to bring you back.
I took this photo last year while this young man talked to a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had the success day that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but to the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the 22 de Julius last year by getting a call from a suicide bomber sitting at the bottom near the center.
<unk> and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking to a <unk> Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were flown up to this two times before New Jersey to try to kill suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking with <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped some <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This guy and a smart man in New Jersey had just taken my life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had the <unk>
<unk> died of suicide affect a lot of people.
I'm telling you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved <unk>
What do you find?
<unk> what to say?
In my experience, it's not only to talk, but you have to listen to it.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person who you know how it feels like because they probably didn't do it.
I'm just standing there, you can be the point of inflection that they need.
If you think someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save the life and be the point of inflection for them.
Other signs of <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do with <unk> social isolation and a loss of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on 19 of January this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience being there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but by noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't really go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with his father the 19 of January.
He never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> it like disappeared at night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the afternoon before.
Thank you very much because of those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who has not been before bad without having a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk on the way his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote to a radio call for a suicide bomber at the sidewalk near the bridge near the north.
<unk> my bike. I looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, she crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and a half ago, I heard like Kevin talked about her depression and <unk>
Kevin decided that day to come back to that lane and give it to my life again.
When Kevin did, it was <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did he made that <unk> and gave the hope and the other <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I am <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Little after that incident, I got a letter from the Kevin, and I got that letter with me, and I'd like to give you to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11th <unk> and you're one of the reasons that Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as it says.
We give God for you.
So I'm going to do with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> When I visited the San Francisco San Francisco at night, and that night, you will be <unk> as the patient.
<unk> I know I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a <unk> of society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people -- or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want your own pain.
All of the general -- this is actually achieved by three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved in, only I've lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I was missing the hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
It was absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact with this bridge is not <unk>
In addition, these few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second that you leave on the top of the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that every single one of us should be able to do to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There is help.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question <unk> How do you get rid of that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I had finally achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For quite complicated reasons, when I go back later, when I look at this photo, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm beginning.
We would all give us our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the constraints in the skin of the skin or the belief that surround us.
They are people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as a <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in the Philippines, and I was always wearing this shirt on my head.
And my mom was, "Why are you always wearing that shirt in <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I am a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that, actually, it's more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I would never bother to share my story, not because I thought to be a bad thing, but because of how the world deals with those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mama, Dad and a family who beat me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me, this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she said, she was responsible for the overhead and <unk> and that night, he won in a bathroom, and he won in a <unk> and she was <unk> a third <unk> between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of <unk>
Not a lot of people who can say their first work was to Queen of <unk> women but I can.
I also met the goddess of the <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you asked America you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was interested in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries -- sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before the name of the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver license with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but to me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York City, and being model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was <unk> he lived his truth, but <unk> put her way to life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we make a global vigil for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who were <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, at this same moment, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and only for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no longer more than 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
They'll you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> -- first, thank you all my <unk>
To my support network, my parents especially, to my family, who is really strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have <unk> and some times, when they were called to me, and they told me that his parents couldn't accept it, I took the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it works -- other don't. It's not just the identity of gender, that's what we are, right?
I mean, we all got assigned a gender to birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the subject that sometimes that task was not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to do, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice, <unk> Thank you.
In many different <unk> societies, the parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education to defending their rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> his efforts in 2011, the National Prize <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm a father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of <unk> inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in recent societies, right from the beginning, when I was born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not coincidentally, or his father or his mother.
The neighborhood comes, he gives her <unk> to mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother would get a lot to have a little girl.
When it comes to the first girl, the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the mother, but the daughter. The newly <unk> daughter when it grows, he suffers from.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she's left home and school admits of her siblings.
Up until the age of 12, in a way, has a good life.
Can you be <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when he comes up in adolescence, when it was 13 years old, he gets to prohibit his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and her family, and if you were to <unk> the code of that of course honor, it could even kill.
And it's interesting that this word of honor, it doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of her sisters in behalf of honor.
And there's one more standard of <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and <unk> the decisions of their father and her mother and the decisions of the elderly even if they don't want to.
If you will, with a man who doesn't like it, or if the <unk> with a old man has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> was very young, it has to follow it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson honor to his kids.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborn to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I was extremely <unk>
And so much before I did, I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and grabbed my pen, <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she turned out when I was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half of my school.
You might be wondering, why should I mention the lesson of a girl in school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of your identity and your name.
One <unk> to school means that he's entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I was <unk> the form of <unk> Canadian form and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters to her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I will sit down with me when my friends would come to see me.
He encouraged me to go to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried <unk> in his personality.
And this was not just for her, just to <unk>
I have <unk> all of these good values in my school to girls and boys in the way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson from the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of engagement in all of the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers who were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, she got up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, blog, was offered her for the documentaries of the New York Times, and I talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
They were <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the October nine of 2012, was shot by <unk> in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, and I was telling him to the ear of my wife -- "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> he said, "Please, don't get <unk>
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get paid.
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot to me, and I didn't go to ask again.
When <unk> was in the hospital and she had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my smile, and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to be fine. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when he doesn't have a task.
They fight their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is a special thing in my <unk> who has made so audacious to <unk> so brave expressive and <unk>
I say, I'm not wondering what I did.
<unk> what I didn't.
I didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm a engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I made it before I join Google or outside my work there.
So having said that, there is a stigma when you give you to a brain operation.
Are you going to be just as smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, more than a dozen different chemicals every day, because if he didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals and try to get them to keep alive.
I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would be able to try to get the <unk> dose, because there isn't a big map that tells you in <unk>
I began to test with <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how small changes in the doses were dramatically <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried dose and chemical chemicals for a man in history, and I was surprised by looking at how I think <unk> my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I believed that it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several different types of things, or perhaps some versions of them.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> so much <unk> fixing a problem that had on the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and what they have to do -- since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do is to make those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was to restore my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my point of key reference -- how to get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thinking is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes will see things in similar ways.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
And there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me it's simple: for most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental for thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I'm able to find the point right and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental imagery quick of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your mind?
There are amazing possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is just to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups that were done by two groups that are done by two groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, to represent the brain here, and you can see the brain scanning that made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The column of the medium shows the brain scan of that same individual as they were <unk> looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the content of the central column on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between looking at an image and imagine to see that same picture.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into the visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos as their brains go to create a big pool of reactions in the brain in front of video.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new animals, and as long as we get a new <unk>
And the computer using only brain brain data is going to be able to show you what it looks like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're close to doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at a picture, and when you imagine that same image, you think of the same <unk>
This led to the scanning brain scanning brain systems today, and its resolution increased as a thousand times over the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How does it happen?
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't give that one.
A lot of people are proposing new techniques of projection for images, even me, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- we must first ask ourselves the following, this technology will be the end of the way.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer little improvements in the resolution, not increases for thousands like we need.
I propose this idea: instead of smaller magnets -- make better magnets better.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to do these really big, right?
However, most of the recent developments in <unk> of ingenious and brilliant and bright solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> radio radio systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field -- even <unk> patterns in magnetic field, <unk> at the frequencies of radio radius.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing patterns of radio processing, we can increase <unk> information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split into layers of knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not only the fluid fluid, but the ones and <unk> that I mentioned that I mentioned and maybe even neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas in direct to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool for amplify our design skills.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more choices to open up this door.
Anyway, you choose one year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet alone.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet may be saying to someone for the first time for the first time or telling someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to do through your life.
So all interestingly, it's a hard conversation and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet something universal is universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope from the <unk> of my <unk> <unk> and I was hanging my head back, I would ask for usually a kid -- "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And it would appear a silent silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father was <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at her son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> in the inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that next time I would say something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time was <unk> and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
The Gloria <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues" I <unk>
And so I took a deep breath and I went down to my back, a little girl in four years with a pink dress with a pink dress, looking at what is a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a guy or <unk>
And so I took a deep back and again, I stood up close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a little boy, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress -- and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
I am more than a girl from a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. They just "Ah, <unk> You're a girl.
What about <unk> <unk>
It was the most easy conversation ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some of us in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how a feels living in a closet.
It's like my closet not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons why I get out of my closet was more difficult than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> It's hard not <unk>
It's difficult to be hard.
Who can tell me that explaining to someone who has declared in banking broken is harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story is harder than telling your son of five years that you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what it's difficult to do with respect to what hard for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, a horse, a dress and <unk> shoes.
I was not the militant lesbian lesbian to fight any kid in four years who would get into the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay, and the move only one muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, complete strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world turned around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all been followed by time, but if you don't throw that <unk> to kill.
One of my most memorable launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that a lot of people were invited to know that he was gay, and when I do my <unk> <unk> on my black dress and <unk> she walked around the tables and finally came to one where my friends were my parents, people who knew I was doing years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women obviously <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of gay history had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in St. <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having a <unk>
<unk> What's your favorite TV program.
Our favorite program Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who we are going, <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of trying to show his support, so I would know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses sanitary <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared to be prepared to be ready for the real <unk>
That's how hard conversations are still going to be my strong point.
Ask for anyone who I had to get through.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means is going out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others must be able to know that we also do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to your parents that maybe they might be gay, they will keep the hope that it could change.
You don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
I would never get rid of that.
And some of you can be injured safe, <unk> for what they've done, but you never feel that they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that you care is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very yourself, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen intelligence, an example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> which was the question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism to the pioneers of the computing like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from a deep race that you don't know anything about the biology or the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on Earth on Earth, you would see how to develop a physical theory that explained how, to a certain point in time, the asteroids that are going on the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that of understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through several disciplines, that I think, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately directly, for the development of intelligence, and in particular, to development of universal states that will be <unk> diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the <unk> <unk> there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom in order to do complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, <unk> from a number of years ago, there's a mechanism behind the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just a equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence I have ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a <unk> F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to maintain open choices with a force T, with the diversity of possible future <unk> Yes, to an impending future, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and to keep the options open.
And so, having in mind this equation, is natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> it is?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have a tendency to more favorable conditions for the existence of smart beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection, <unk> between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually arises from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system in which you find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could be multiple of the animal intelligence, playing games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of that without being told to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for <unk> robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability of using tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing.
In addition, like some other animals can cooperate by pulling away from opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we do successfully play a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where friends are constantly pouring up and keeps successful net <unk>
This same capacity of <unk> also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> to organize the routes of a fleet of ships, discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to extend the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see that we will spontaneously discover and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiation negotiation in their successfully increasing assets under their management exponentially.
This ability to risk risk management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as using tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all flow from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back at the beginning of the term the term -- robot, <unk> was always the concept that if you were to <unk> smart machines would have a <unk> rebellion of it.
So the machines are attached to us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion in the other way.
It's not that machines are getting smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the other way that the urge to take control of all of the future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control, instead of being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you get goals to be learned from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to help the descendants of the descendants of us to help build artificial warning or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, over the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth is in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the dim <unk> of the stars when the planets go in front of them, and they block a little bit of that light that comes to us.
The data came up by Kepler show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there are between them and their stem star.
In together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their own.
In turn, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest hot year.
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us for millennia now is now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have rapidly <unk> our ability to disrupt our course.
But I'm not a weather scientist and no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with hope to find places in the universe where you find life beyond our planet.
I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, like someone very interested in finding life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more than our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially <unk> world shown that by a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past and part of it is why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track its surface into search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
<unk> satellites like the <unk> mission take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not only short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these pictures <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas that are linked and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and tallest places on the Earth is fresh and full of oxygen -- it goes through our forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization, of Mars and other planets I'm going to get a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some that Mars will expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable Earth.
So for a lot that I like the exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there for <unk> to humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party actually will have place later on <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration, <unk> and land preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's only getting closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces, in the hostile and land areas of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment called the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi I said, <unk> in mind that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that are going to build this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to engage the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I ran my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see out the window that were at the dining table, where there was a <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all were pretty closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> would take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back from my friend of Jeff <unk> to pass night because I had an early flight in Europe and the next morning, and I was <unk> from my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive -- but you secure not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I was going on to be stopped.
I'm a <unk> a profession and a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rhythm, and <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> thinking.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that could be done in their place, that <unk> that were going to happen.
Or at least if you do bad things, that will be <unk> the probability of it's a total disaster.
So I got to think about that, but until one month later, my thoughts.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> <unk> the winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I talked about the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and I was Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might go wrong, then tries to figure out what can do to prevent the things outside or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not that evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious thing.
And in the house, we would find a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the fish, where the fish, where the fish, the <unk> trees -- where the tribes and friends live in and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that lets the <unk> find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of the <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys on your car, glasses of reading and <unk>
So at home, I would find a place for your keys, a hook along the door, maybe a plate <unk>
For your passport, it was a particular illusion.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they're <unk> with it all their things will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take with your cell phone card, a picture of your credit card license leave your drive, your email cards to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can be <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases your eyes.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> thinking.
So part of the practical practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved person to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the decision-making decisions, and in fact that for the decision-making and social decisions, any kind of decision that we need to take from a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol result is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack the heart injury.
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol cholesterol is the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even if you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do so, an statistic that you have to ask for most doctors don't want to talk, and companies companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or having a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of <unk> statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's somebody's fault -- it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms of <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number we need to treat the most widely <unk> which you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of the cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, or a brain attack or another traumatic event.
Now maybe you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> from the <unk> effects? Right?
For this particular drug -- the side effects produce in five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but they are now saying, <unk> five percent is not very likely to happen to me, even how to take the <unk>
But a moment.
And remember, under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how to do this with the time, so you don't have to make the chain of thinking on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to come out with the drug that you can help you medicine.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is required, is part of the informed consent principle.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number that we need to treat is quite typical.
So for the surgery that is done in the older men in the age of 50 percent of prostate cancer, the number we need to treat is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that we will take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, they want a more short life free of pain, or a longest life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change from opinion at the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they shut down a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> in face with a lens, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get to be lunch for the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thinking, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we need to be able to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail from time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> could be able to put the systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent things wrong with the first place.
<unk> the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> with the door, with a key door at the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I have not ordered and lots of messages I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> is my favorite symbol of music.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there that you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never come to a complete silence.
That's my definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the Russian system, the <unk> in addition to a little story.
The French language came over the decade in 1800, and at the time of the time, they mixed with some local signs, and it became the language that we know as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a person who lives in a world of sound, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I have learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people black people.
So I've learned, for example ...
"I don't know the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you make sure you don't get <unk> in the <unk>
This is all called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm so <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for the sound, the sound is coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
They are going to go forward.
<unk> by <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, I do this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited a museums and a space of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me <unk>
There was no visual art.
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
Is it going to be more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or a sense of it, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And all I had taught me how to sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a little bit of a person <unk>
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my art job, or I could tell me.
I chose to make me angry.
There's a massive culture around the spoken language.
And because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking <unk> their voices, I am able to hold a temporary form of value something like taking a loan from a very high interest rate.
If we wouldn't continue to do with this practice, I feel that it could be <unk> in <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't catch and express on the paper.
And the same is true of a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> <unk> in many different parameters <unk>
If you mapping a different <unk> for every finger while you touch the piano, like the facial expression, the <unk> the shape of the hand and so on, as the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you get it to just a room at once.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 fingers in order to express a concept or idea in <unk>
If only a change would change in it, it would create a completely different meaning.
Same with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters and you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it back and again, it could be like a piece of visual music here.
For example, this is the <unk> sign -- the sun comes out and it goes off.
This is the day."
If you put it and <unk> the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be true of <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> the <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how far your body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is both closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last thing is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think it would automatically look at <unk> itself.
Watch <unk> <unk> right, <unk> left.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of them in high hands.
Now we're going to do it both in your head as a chest like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages throughout the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this: Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third one, please, <unk> again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Notice how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they do very different meanings themselves.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and lives like music.
However, today, we live in a very small world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it doesn't have a social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not that you have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to try to open his ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a innocence of innocence or a bubble bubble from ignorance to say, because adults lie to us to protect ourselves from the awful truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults also <unk> and they're not very good at cleaning up others.
Time country, now I'm an adult and teaching citizenship and invention in the <unk> of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk down the beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, they cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to collect those little pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> job <unk> so that the kids very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you the kids that manipulate electrical tools feel great, secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean -- which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try and take the best ideas of each child and try to focus on something that we hope it works.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the children are actually getting a lot with the robots.
And then we created very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast at creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned light bulbs and web cameras and <unk> it into a floating robot that gets slowly moving through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image of captured by the robot.
We see those plastic chunks floating slowly through the sensor while the computer computer actually process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an approximate estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I am able to investigate my problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it was <unk> with this species.
A child, maybe under 10 years, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> where the water lives in.
You can also see that the water is brown and the mud and the oil are also brown color, and when it's all <unk> it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
So let's take this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was able to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to tackle a more difficult problem, and I was closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and probably remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died at a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power station in the water.
And today, according to the average reports of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination from <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that the most part of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and the most part, at the moment, it looks safe -- it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident, and independently <unk> with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course we didn't get them -- the parents don't know it.
But every night I went down to the center of <unk> here, you see the use of <unk>
It might seem like they didn't do work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all his life.
Along with them, we discussed the data that comes through that day and talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the city of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We could see that the <unk> dust <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this, we organized a civil <unk> the nearest of the nuclear power to date.
We can zoom up to a half miles of the nuclear station, and with the fishermen of the <unk> we went to collect sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it has been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple source.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a so small so much, we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with <unk> metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically, can be built almost all of it there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become reality with help in adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with energy.
So for example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age of age, transforming their blood chairs into new <unk> vehicles.
<unk> plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, creators -- we need to prepare the next generation to care for the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a silk silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other one thought of it.
One is designed by nature, the other one.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fights for free.
The <unk> was only a tool.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, cells, we carry all the information for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production production.
The lines of assembly have dictated a world -- <unk> the imagination of designers and architects and trained them to think of their objects as <unk> of <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk>
You acts mainly as a filter the other mostly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that varies gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world -- the <unk> of each of the <unk> and architect to work on the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between assembly and growth, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, and we have a little bit shown in both screens behind me.
My work, at the most simple level, is about bringing these two visions of the world, moving away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask you why now?
Why couldn't this be 10 or even five years ago.
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they have four disciplines that offers designers to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my students' hands.
We design objects, and products and tools and tools through scales -- scale, as this robotic arm with a <unk> of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> basis, that someday you know, <unk> <unk> and graphics to the nanoscale <unk> <unk> <unk> in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of ancient architecture -- Arab architecture and has created a screen where every opening is just size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a <unk> fashion debate, and it's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing with 3D printing -- we printed this layer and 3D <unk> between the cells. I'm going to show you more objects like that.
This headset combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
This is also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high-tech <unk> and to the <unk> instruments it allows to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed an acoustic chair a chair to the comfortable structural and also absorbs sound.
Professor Carter professor came back to nature to <unk> and to design this pattern of surface surface -- becomes <unk>
They put this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, varies their functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> it will continuously and <unk> the material.
But it's the natural nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jewish house, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them became a lot of a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a tree <unk> <unk>
For that first tree -- there would be no difference between trunk, full leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world in place.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if the objects made it out of a single part?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we were looking for the material that <unk> the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruits, and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons produced every year by organisms like shrimp, or, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can tune into your properties, we could generate structures that will be able to generate a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We asked a lot of <unk> <unk> and we collected <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the soft, soft and transparent.
To print the structures on a big scale, built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material of the march and create these structures made out of one half a half a half a half a half a half feet long, 100 percent recyclable
When the pieces are lists, you leave it off to find a natural way to the contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT <unk> the bacteria designed genetically to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> to mesh, and if it extends even more, windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with a ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed on the ground, help grow a tree.
The journey for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the board, we did our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> new colors into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothes, you have two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One converts light into sugar, the other <unk> sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never come up.
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to hold these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like to the vocal tract. which will help us build these bacteria and to get them to get their function of path.
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to the functionality <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> channels more transparent.
This <unk> digestive system, when it stretches from one end to another, is 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our intestine <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are old creatures, only half is <unk>
What if the design would get the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> our own tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer does <unk> material.
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated <unk> architecture within which they were <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It makes it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, <unk> those fibers together.
And this is happening through scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
<unk> and <unk> the two forces in life, manifest themselves in one material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk silk <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors -- and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the cocoon of the silk.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different environments, different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of <unk> are transmitted directly by the environment.
Often the silk worms are going to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we looked at this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making <unk> silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk silk worms to the more dark and <unk> areas that we use a solar path to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, distributing the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> of silk to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to get it to us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they were <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion and integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, they were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry symmetry -- this is also the length of the route of silk.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to make the products and the buildings around us, to form a number of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at first.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from an inspired design in nature to a nature inspired by the first time, which demands of us, for the first time, we will take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were asked when they asked them for the first time.
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school, I liked English, the <unk> and the art and he was able to finish the website, I also played the guitar in a punk called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge.
And I have to give it back.
But then I met myself for something else, a totally different thing, and I'm going to get involved in it, and I'm going to get my <unk> and I have found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it to you.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all of my other passions, and I would think of <unk>
Another reason that it caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was worried to be afraid of commitment, or being recruited or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked you then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
So let me tell you where they did, they learned about culture.
Do you first ask yourself, "What do you want to be <unk>
We have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares what they would say to that age.
It's considered a naive question to make nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question gets us over and again as you grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students get asked to choose in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what you take the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream what they might be, is not inspired to dream everything they might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adult adults might be <unk> and say, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine turned into <unk> <unk> a teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something that each of us have to spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and devote your life to it.
But if you're someone connected to this way?
What happens if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and a lot of different things that wants to do?
There's no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel it.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath for this to say.
It could help you split up in three <unk> <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms to be used by the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time of the Renaissance the ideal was who I was very <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of <unk> to a community, we cannot agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as <unk> or woe you should win.
But what I've learned to talk about talking about people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in organizations, visualizing and design and design, and to start <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this whole idea for its <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens at intersections.
That's the new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background, can access a lot of these <unk> points.
The second superpower <unk> is very quick.
When we manage them, we are <unk> and we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and independent writer is <unk>
As a child pianist -- an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known <unk>
Before it became a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales of sales when they started their own, and this ability to write the shapes for the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time to do what you would give you to do, even if you end it up.
Is it possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. That is, the ability to transform whatever you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other websites, sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, and sometimes a teacher, and sometimes James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their customers.
The journal <unk> Company defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the needs of the marketplace, which is really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they are <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the belly knowing they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams have come up with a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The agent can dive deep in and put ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to deal with the way we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them are told to be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing that you take out of this talk, I hope that it's this: <unk> with the internal wiring is whatever.
If you are a heart attack, then you go through all media.
That's where you give the best of you.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, the world will be <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric psychiatric bar.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
Her doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After her death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If you could have been living today, we couldn't give it more help than he <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral drugs for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's a little bit of progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, including many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 years or more, the chance of Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability that you spend your years with Alzheimer's or Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or to be dear to Alzheimer's disease.
Already in America, Alzheimer's <unk> costs 200 dollars per year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs to increase five times in 2050, as 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been made relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's of the fact that Alzheimer's disease costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a decade of a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but the whole world. Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of the scientists, the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only to look at a picture of a healthy heart brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's percent significantly longer life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that it folds as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, these dots are going to end up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are left in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that you can do it, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of the wires have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical, physicists and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's actually testing a new kind of drugs that are testing specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see they move with normal.
These fingertips on the other hand, have molecules of protein that sticks with each other within them, like Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result: but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to warn us that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments and pharmaceutical companies and <unk>
That was essential to move forward into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So, it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
All the world with a brain runs at risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the neocortical column of the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, I do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and of my own experience that I test it was one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strange <unk> to make you 36 more and more and more and then they are looking at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple questions.
Number two: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you had another person?
And <unk>
<unk> that <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me with your partner what you like to do, or he was, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't have ever known to.
When I first came with this study a few years ago, a very detail really struck me attention, the fun that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but then it was also <unk>
And when I had the time I tried to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect <unk>
But I thought that it was a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the neocortical column a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably asked you to even be wondering, keep up to me?"
And the reason I think I think about this is because they've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had told me to write about my experience on romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can get to a few hundreds of views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably a few thousands of view.
And that took a very good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But they had no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night, and on Saturday, and this happened on the traffic on my blog.
And the Sunday, already had been called today's "Today and the Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million pages, and I was like, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust writing with faith in their own experience, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call or <unk> what they did every day for weeks -- they were doing the same question: Are they still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international lifetime, you should expect people to feel comfortable wondering about it.
But I was not prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article for St. <unk> who included the experiences of readers to test the study in different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both made a public emergence together.
And I would collect TV interviews, and they were <unk> orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons of the <unk> process -- a range for the one that I didn't feel at all of the <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if I really wanted to know if it was able to produce <unk> love not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you go together or not, and in addition to <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for interpersonal <unk> among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds Romantic right?
But the study did work.
Participants felt more close after doing that many, many later studies, they were also used <unk> protocol <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they've used it between people from the opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, and combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, it was cited in this paper, but unfortunately he never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you get rid of the person with whom you do it."
Well he made a program.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> I know that they were able to get better better after test the research.
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came up with the first time when I was 29 and <unk> and I was going through a really hard <unk>
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to almost all my adult life, and he was my first real love -- and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I took back to science.
And I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that that could be somehow <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I only worked for the book I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I met with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I felt then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably than reasonably demand me.
What I'm looking for of love is a chance -- not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to be <unk> on the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that the media told you about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate something in a way to mitigate and this is a very compelling story, because in love it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the history of the story that he says, is still together?
And their content with an answer of yes or No.
So more than a question, you know that asking questions more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So, if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known thing and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love in love is not the same thing that remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> Love didn't happen.
<unk> fallen in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit about reading it now, not because it's not true, but because in the moment, I had nothing to be supposed to do that choice.
I didn't think how many times would you both take that decision, and how much of the time I will have to keep making that choice without knowing before he always chose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, to have chosen to love someone so generous, kind and fun and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship in the kind of myth that I don't really believe about.
And what I did, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending of implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some lesbian lesbian and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
New York City makes a time --  -- something that really affected me but more detail later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and you get a dollar bill -- a <unk> and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or some aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like going from tour and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> by Agnes Martin, the covers of resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and is <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking that he could <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite: in some way it seemed to increase the text with a <unk>
So I did <unk> I built more boxes.
This time, I began to add electronic elements, the strange bottles that I was finding on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for all my life, trying to get them back and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realize that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing just like a <unk> in the crime scene.
And I took out the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, <unk> from the ones that you can do an idea.
Then I made insects and strangers.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great. man.
At some point I was interested in the human form, sculptures of resin of human beings in the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was shocked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing in a window, then in the other window and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know it.
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
Five feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animals are moving between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, this <unk> <unk> where they were <unk>
This is where the animals with animals are heading to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird of a bird tied into a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of Osama Bin Laden, are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also kind of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out the oil in a hand while the other hand is coming out of it.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, you have a <unk> like a bird spike and it spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Anyway, the tail is made fire by <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
Her tail ends up in a <unk> eye balloon -- made out of terrorist cards.
They have <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were the baseball cards.
It takes me to his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They are like cells, they come together.
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs a pound of kilos with a human trapped inside.
This is a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of your chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of thing.
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't get it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
They can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a <unk> <unk> a <unk> a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world -- and a garden.
It takes up the box and all the people in it strikes each other like particles.
And I think that's the way we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that's living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect on pain, first goes through the stomach, the guts and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system for any drug to be able to have any effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that when we <unk> any medicine <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are going to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known for their side effects -- in their side <unk> because in the time that it takes to get to the current car, they will be <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to reach its fate, which is where it's most important, in the HIV warehouse
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily get in the blood stream of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells <unk>
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life run by a oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "I've got to get the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for caring about wounds and surgery for diabetes -- they can be used for anything else -- including <unk> transport of drugs.
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open or drill extremely small, <unk> holes that open and closing almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce the drugs.
They ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of a laser beam on the cellular membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even know it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to take this technology to the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, that is our laser -- we'll make a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is moving to the site of infection.
Finally, third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all research on <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied by armed groups, not by armed organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot 'n.
My goal is to better understand these agents of violence from violence and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation to the confrontation not violent.
I do a job work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solve almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> deals with peace in 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of political conflict.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one looks at what they do when they didn't go to it.
The armed struggle and political <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party and a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
It's multitasking is multitasking people.
<unk> a complex machinery of communication, radio stations TV channels, websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed magazine magazine in English and published to <unk>
Local groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but by a business -- for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else -- create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, put in a professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Local groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn by the war or even the beginning of <unk> <unk> can be understood by the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price rich for the population.
But in general, providing social services means to fill a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory in 2006, of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario scenario -- even in the West, when we looked at <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up gaps in the government, and they come up with the armed and political groups, participating in violent fight and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated people are these organizations, we can less <unk> as something opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run all their <unk> collect the trash, run the <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the more weak ones are states, like the Middle East, the more <unk> and fill that gap.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in tools not military tools.
<unk> that standard of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and <unk> peace.
If we better understand groups -- we will understand better what incentives to offer the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, the military power can win some <unk> but it doesn't give us peace or stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill out that safety vacuum of the government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid that will accept openly the <unk> tag would be unfair to the <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I'm going to feel like a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what it started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a little bit bigger.
Let me step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and that we have sex with the sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated in the world and anger, in particular, it seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> that could be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> word and unpleasant.
And I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asks too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's just like a man.
Nobody wants to be that <unk> woman until you realize that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I began to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They would have the same paycheck for the same job.
We have the right to travel around the world like <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have the right to use very easy and accessible to contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for <unk> or <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have to account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition and skills and much more.
We need to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make a bad feminist feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive your work, I hear rap music -- all volume.
Even though the letter degrades women and it makes me deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of Yin yang -- it's amazing.
<unk> actually with your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical name.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks, but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and the maintenance of <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
They talked about fashion journals.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> stories that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise his children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to the same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable to when they <unk>
And we would have this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has bypassed or <unk> historically the needs of color of color, and gay workers and <unk> for white, elderly and high class.
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist feminist would.
It also happens to happen, as a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it will be <unk>
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider to be <unk> from that <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid of standing up and say, "Yes, I'm a <unk> of fear that means that label for fear of not being able to fulfill a little bit of <unk>
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years it's a <unk> feminist thing.
In the <unk> Music <unk> of 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> of three feet tall.
It was a <unk> show to see this star of the pop-up embrace openly and to know women and young men who be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics began endless debates if it was <unk> it was not a feminist thing.
<unk> their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk>
<unk> perfection of <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, and we need so <unk> a lot.
We're going to go much further out of the sane criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until it's nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give the action and be a little more <unk>
If I listen to music -- I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we manage the change affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does her music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions can justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
They are two little <unk> <unk> and bright and very <unk> I want to grow in a world.
And they were getting rid of the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice will be <unk> as a much easier thing to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially young men can say, "You can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, engaging in your project, or working with you, until you don't include a number of women, so to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but we would try to participate in this kind of projects, and we can also engage ourselves to be including even more like us to get to overcome the barriers to the <unk>
Because we are not <unk>  Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these little courage acts of courage and hope that our decisions get to the top of the people in the directors of directors and art producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a change lasting change.
We can also affirm the courage with our feminism, good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, most of all, because I <unk> my voice <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to cope with what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was getting into a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like me, and of the women who looked like me, and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing, and I also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to get anything.
And in the other, I have a <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that all of us can be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> for having visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things from this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with an immune immune system is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak -- they had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> the autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and the vaccines that are <unk> and tagged in a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most smart scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of the growth of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard of it to be able to develop all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, estimates of prevalence followed as only three or four children per 100,000.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> fundraising organizations like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic, as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Center for Disease Control Center at Atlanta what is going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic and <unk> <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to get out, why were they so <unk> at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less than to do with slow progress and <unk> from the science that with the most <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism than had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds <unk> the people of her around, even their own parents.
They could have fun during hours by waving their hands in their faces, but they were prey to panic as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing it.
Over the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the 1950s, as a major authority of the world in the subject, declared that I'd seen less than 150 real cases of his syndrome as far as the references of places like South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, I will give that diagnosis to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he had turned to nine of every 10 children that he had turned to his office to her office by being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child is caused by <unk> and <unk>
These kids, he said, they've been kept carefully at a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in your clinic could tell between 18 <unk> before they turned to two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like children were just going to be, what they had heard of their parents were desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> psychologist in London, thought that the theory of welfare mothers was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were the warm people and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like <unk> without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They ran a study of HIV prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find autistic children in the community.
What you saw was that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was a lot more <unk> and diverse in trouble.
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by the astrophysics, of dinosaurs or the <unk> of the <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in nice <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model would have predicted.
Early on, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one ever realize these children before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then he would be buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
I knew about this article in the competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation to English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was German, and he <unk> for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music, with music, and children followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as a disability <unk> of life that required <unk> <unk> and <unk> spaces during the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called her little teachers, and he started to help in the development of education that were especially suitable for them.
<unk> saw autism as a continual diverse continual variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always have been, watching aspects of this continuum in architectural <unk> known in pop culture as a awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a grain of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s and principles of the '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> for a wide <unk>
These changes were not on a broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked together to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents around the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
She shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these trials created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses began to <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it was, making the people with autism and their families finally <unk> support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in <unk> a simple, powerful story, and <unk> new history as a <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
Over the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles for solving new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way of understanding <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean that it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and there's a deficit deficit to the details.
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We have all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste not a brain.
Thank you.
